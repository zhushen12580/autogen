The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nteachable_agent (to user):\n\n- Title: Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4\n- Innovation: GPT-4, an LLM with remarkable capabilities, demonstrates human-level performance across various domains, like math, coding, vision, medicine, law, and psychology.\n- Key results: GPT-4 significantly surpasses prior models, suggesting it may be an early version of AGI; limitations and challenges toward deeper AGI are also discussed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"example-4---learning-new-skills",children:"Example 4 - Learning new skills"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Users can extend the teachable agent's capabilities by teaching it new skills for accomplishing challenging tasks.
