Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself? Leveraging Human and AI Correctness\n  Likelihood to Promote Appropriate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision-Making\nAbstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to\nknow when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies\ncalibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI\'s correctness\nlikelihood (CL) but ignored humans\' CL, hindering optimal team decision-making.\nTo mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans\' appropriate trust based on\nthe CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans\' CL by\napproximating their decision-making models and computing their potential\nperformance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and\neffectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three\nCL exploitation strategies to calibrate users\' trust explicitly/implicitly in\nthe AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects\nexperiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more\nappropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We\nfurther provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted\ndecision-making.\n\n2. Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration\n  in AI-Assisted Decision Making\nAbstract: Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often\nundesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because\nhuman experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model\'s\nto ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision\nmaking, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to\noptimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately\n\\textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when\nto trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply\ntheir knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely\nto perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision\nmaking in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores\nwhether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate\ntrust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we\nstudy the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a\nparticular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence\nscore can help calibrate people\'s trust in an AI model, but trust calibration\nalone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also\ndepend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement\nthe AI\'s errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for\nAI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to\nexplore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.\n\n3. Trust Explanations to Do What They Say\nAbstract: How much are we to trust a decision made by an AI algorithm? Trusting an\nalgorithm without cause may lead to abuse, and mistrusting it may similarly\nlead to disuse. Trust in an AI is only desirable if it is warranted; thus,\ncalibrating trust is critical to ensuring appropriate use. In the name of\ncalibrating trust appropriately, AI developers should provide contracts\nspecifying use cases in which an algorithm can and cannot be trusted. Automated\nexplanation of AI outputs is often touted as a method by which trust can be\nbuilt in the algorithm. However, automated explanations arise from algorithms\nthemselves, so trust in these explanations is similarly only desirable if it is\nwarranted. Developers of algorithms explaining AI outputs (xAI algorithms)\nshould provide similar contracts, which should specify use cases in which an\nexplanation can and cannot be trusted.\n\n4. A Systematic Literature Review of User Trust in AI-Enabled Systems: An\n  HCI Perspective\nAbstract: User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been\nincreasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It\nhas been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric\napproaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core\nprinciple of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to\nprovide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and\nmeasurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future\ntechnical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the\nuser AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to\ndefine trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user\ntrust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing\ndefinitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by\nthree main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design\nfeatures, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings,\nreinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to\nmonitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be\naddressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or\ndiscussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding\nthe optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.\n\n5. Trust Calibration and Trust Respect: A Method for Building Team Cohesion\n  in Human Robot Teams\nAbstract: Recent advances in the areas of human-robot interaction (HRI) and robot\nautonomy are changing the world. Today robots are used in a variety of\napplications. People and robots work together in human autonomous teams (HATs)\nto accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust\nbetween robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective\nteam cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI,\nhuman trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the\nrobotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low\nperformance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task\nfailures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is\nalso important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is\nexhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger,\ndistraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to\ncalibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to\nrespect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human\nshould trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its\nfeedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust\ncalibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans. This\ninformation is potentially useful in aiding a robot it its decision to respect\ntrust.\n\n6. Trust Considerations for Explainable Robots: A Human Factors Perspective\nAbstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have drawn\nattention to the need for AI systems and robots to be understandable to human\nusers. The explainable AI (XAI) and explainable robots literature aims to\nenhance human understanding and human-robot team performance by providing users\nwith necessary information about AI and robot behavior. Simultaneously, the\nhuman factors literature has long addressed important considerations that\ncontribute to human performance, including human trust in autonomous systems.\nIn this paper, drawing from the human factors literature, we discuss three\nimportant trust-related considerations for the design of explainable robot\nsystems: the bases of trust, trust calibration, and trust specificity. We\nfurther detail existing and potential metrics for assessing trust in robotic\nsystems based on explanations provided by explainable robots.\n\n7. Experimental Investigation of Trust in Anthropomorphic Agents as Task\n  Partners\nAbstract: This study investigated whether human trust in a social robot with\nanthropomorphic physicality is similar to that in an AI agent or in a human in\norder to clarify how anthropomorphic physicality influences human trust in an\nagent. We conducted an online experiment using two types of cognitive tasks,\ncalculation and emotion recognition tasks, where participants answered after\nreferring to the answers of an AI agent, a human, or a social robot. During the\nexperiment, the participants rated their trust levels in their partners. As a\nresult, trust in the social robot was basically neither similar to that in the\nAI agent nor in the human and instead settled between them. The results showed\na possibility that manipulating anthropomorphic features would help assist\nhuman users in appropriately calibrating trust in an agent.\n\n8. Uncalibrated Models Can Improve Human-AI Collaboration\nAbstract: In many practical applications of AI, an AI model is used as a decision aid\nfor human users. The AI provides advice that a human (sometimes) incorporates\ninto their decision-making process. The AI advice is often presented with some\nmeasure of "confidence" that the human can use to calibrate how much they\ndepend on or trust the advice. In this paper, we present an initial exploration\nthat suggests showing AI models as more confident than they actually are, even\nwhen the original AI is well-calibrated, can improve human-AI performance\n(measured as the accuracy and confidence of the human\'s final prediction after\nseeing the AI advice). We first train a model to predict human incorporation of\nAI advice using data from thousands of human-AI interactions. This enables us\nto explicitly estimate how to transform the AI\'s prediction confidence, making\nthe AI uncalibrated, in order to improve the final human prediction. We\nempirically validate our results across four different tasks--dealing with\nimages, text and tabular data--involving hundreds of human participants. We\nfurther support our findings with simulation analysis. Our findings suggest the\nimportance of jointly optimizing the human-AI system as opposed to the standard\nparadigm of optimizing the AI model alone.\n\n9. Knowing About Knowing: An Illusion of Human Competence Can Hinder\n  Appropriate Reliance on AI Systems\nAbstract: The dazzling promises of AI systems to augment humans in various tasks hinge\non whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown\nthat appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team\nperformance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an\nunder-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people\ncan hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive\nbias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and\nperformance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of\nDKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be\nmitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI\nadvice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user\nunderstanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their\nperformance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal\nteam performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either\nimproving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate\nreliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users\ncalibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among\nparticipants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can\npotentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated\nself-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to\ntackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI\nsystems. Our findings advance the current understanding of the role of\nself-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This\nlays out promising future directions for relevant HCI research in this\ncommunity.\n\n10. A Turing Test for Transparency\nAbstract: A central goal of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the\ntrust relationship in human-AI interaction. One assumption underlying research\nin transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess\npredictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to\nidentify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however\nshows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting\nexplanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even\nwhen these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be\nattributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This\neffect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of\ntransparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish\nmachine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative\nmetric for XAI methods based on Turing\'s imitation game, a Turing Test for\nTransparency. A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was\ngenerated by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can\nnot be detected by humans above chance performance in this binary\nclassification task are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a\nrequirement for assessing and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI\ninteraction. We present experimental results on a crowd-sourced text\nclassification task demonstrating that even for basic ML models and XAI\napproaches most participants were not able to differentiate human from machine\ngenerated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical implications of our\nresults for applications of transparent ML.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nAfter analyzing the abstracts of the top 10 arxiv papers related to trust calibration in AI-based systems, I have identified the following application domains studied by these papers:\n\n1.
