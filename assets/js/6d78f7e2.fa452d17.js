Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties in completing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due to their inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly. This paper introduces \"Smurfs\", a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designed to revolutionize the application of LLMs. By transforming a conventional LLM into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs enhances task decomposition and execution without necessitating extra training. This is achieved through innovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model, thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents. The framework gives access to external tools to efficiently solve complex tasks. Our empirical investigation, featuring the mistral-7b-instruct model as a case study, showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilization scenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches the ChatGPT-ReACT in the ToolBench I2 and I3 benchmark with a remarkable 84.4% win rate, surpassing the highest recorded performance of a GPT-4 model at 73.5%. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of the multi-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration of multi-agent LLM systems.         \u25b3 Less\nLink: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05955\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the abstract of the paper titled \"Smurfs: Leveraging Multiple Proficiency Agents with Context-Efficiency for Tool Planning,\" the key findings and potential applications of GPT-4 can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Key Findings:\n- The paper introduces \"Smurfs,\" a multi-agent framework that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 by transforming them into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble.
