Train 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\n```python\nimport flaml\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example Data (Please provide real data in practice)\ndata = {\n    "feature1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    "feature2": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    # ... add all features you need for your classification\n    "label": [\'a\', \'b\', \'a\', \'a\', \'b\'],  # assuming binary classification with labels \'a\' and \'b\'\n}\n\n# Convert to Pandas DataFrame\npdf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Generate pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(pdf)\n\n# Organize data into feature vectors and labels\nlabel_col = "label"\nfeature_cols = [col for col in psdf.columns if col != label_col]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\n\n# Apply the transformation\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features", label_col]\n\n# Prepare AutoML settings\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "accuracy",  # Change this to a classification metric you prefer\n    "task": "classification",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,  # Or other number that fits your Spark cluster configuration\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Enable force cancel to obey the time constraint\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # Specify SparkML estimators you want to try\n}\n\n# Create an AutoML instance\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\n\n# Run the AutoML search\nautoml.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label_col, **automl_settings)\n``` \n\nRemember to replace the example data with your real dataset and choose an appropriate metric for your classification task.

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nThe authors of FLAML (Fast and Lightweight AutoML) as mentioned in the provided context are Chi Wang, Qingyun Wu, Markus Weimer, and Erkang Zhu.

First, use `to_pandas_on_spark` function to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require. Next, you should use `VectorAssembler` to merge all feature columns into a single vector column. Finally, use `flaml.AutoML` to try different configurations for the `lgbm_spark` model. Here is an example code snippet: \n\n```python\nimport flaml\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\n# load your stock price data into a pandas dataframe\ndata = pd.read_csv(\'stock_price.csv\')\n\n# specify label column name\nlabel = \'price\'\n\n# convert pandas dataframe to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(data)\n\n# merge feature columns as a single vector column\nfeature_cols = [col for col in psdf.columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n\n# start an AutoML experiment with lgbm_spark estimator\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nragproxyagent (to assistant):\n\nI want the time_budget to be 10 mins\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI want the time_budget to be 10 mins\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nYou can change the `time_budget` parameter in the `settings` dictionary to 10 minutes (600 seconds) like this:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\n# load your stock price data into a pandas dataframe\ndata = pd.read_csv(\'stock_price.csv\')\n\n# specify label column name\nlabel = \'price\'\n\n# convert pandas dataframe to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(data)\n\n# merge feature columns as a single vector column\nfeature_cols = [col for col in psdf.columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n\n# start an AutoML experiment with lgbm_spark estimator and time_budget of 10 mins\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 600,  # time_budget in seconds\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n\nIn this example, the `time_budget` parameter is set to 600, which represents the number of seconds the FLAML AutoML experiment will run. You can adjust this value to control the total time spent on the experiment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nragproxyagent (to assistant):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"example-4",children:"Example 4"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"#table-of-contents",children:"Back to top"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Use RetrieveChat to answer a question and ask for human-in-loop\nfeedbacks."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Problem: Is there a function named ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"tune_automl"})," in FLAML?"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-python",children:'# reset the assistant.

You must follow the formats below to write your code:\n```language\n# your code\n```\n\nUser\'s question is: Is there a function named `tune_automl` in FLAML?\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {"Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n      "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n      "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000]}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performs parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True, # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n\n# Research\n\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n\n* [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True, # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n\n# Research\n\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n\n* [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50 % of outstanding shares , or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent . </P>\n<P> The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm 's assets , liabilities and equity ( capital ) at a set point in time , usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement . The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount . This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation - Assets = Liabilities + Equity . The statement can be used to help show the status of a company . </P>\n<P> The comptroller ( who is also auditor general and head of the National Audit Office ) controls both the Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund . The full official title of the role is Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty 's Exchequer . </P>\n<P> Financing activities include the inflow of cash from investors such as banks and shareholders , as well as the outflow of cash to shareholders as dividends as the company generates income . Other activities which impact the long - term liabilities and equity of the company are also listed in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement . </P>\n<P> It is frequently claimed that annual accounts have not been certified by the external auditor since 1994 . In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 EU Budget , the Court of Auditors found that the two biggest areas of the EU budget , agriculture and regional spending , have not been signed off on and remain `` materially affected by error '' . </P>\n<P> The Ministry of Finance , Government of India announces the rate of interest for PPF account every quarter . The current interest rate effective from 1 January 2018 is 7.6 % Per Annum ' ( compounded annually ) . Interest will be paid on 31 March every year . Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month . </P>\n<Table> <Tr> <Th> Quarter </Th> <Th> Interest Rate </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> April 2018 - June 2018 </Td> <Td> 7.6 % </Td> </Tr> </Table>\n<P> For a percentage of the settlement amount , Public adjusters work exclusively for the policyholder . This means there should be no inherent conflict of interest when it comes to advocating on the policyholder 's behalf to the insurance company . </P>\n<P> Accounts receivable is a legally enforceable claim for payment held by a business for goods supplied and / or services rendered that customers / clients have ordered but not paid for . These are generally in the form of invoices raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame . Accounts receivable is shown in a balance sheet as an asset . It is one of a series of accounting transactions dealing with the billing of a customer for goods and services that the customer has ordered . These may be distinguished from notes receivable , which are debts created through formal legal instruments called promissory notes . </P>\n<P> A common synonym for net profit when discussing financial statements ( which include a balance sheet and an income statement ) is the bottom line . This term results from the traditional appearance of an income statement which shows all allocated revenues and expenses over a specified time period with the resulting summation on the bottom line of the report . </P>\n<Table> Electronic Fund Transfer Act <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Other short titles </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 </Li> <Li> Change in Bank Control Act </Li> <Li> Change in Savings and Loan Control Act </Li> <Li> Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act </Li> <Li> Export - Import Bank Act Amendments </Li> <Li> Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act </Li> <Li> National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility Act </Li> <Li> Right to Financial Privacy Act </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Long title </Th> <Td> An Act to extend the authority for the flexible regulation of interest rates on deposits and accounts in depository institutions . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Nicknames </Th> <Td> American Arts Gold Medallion Act </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Enacted by </Th> <Td> the 95th United States Congress </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Effective </Th> <Td> November 10 , 1978 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Citations </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Public law </Th> <Td> 95 - 630 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Statutes at Large </Th> <Td> 92 Stat. 3641 aka 92 Stat. 3728 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Codification </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Titles amended </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> 12 U.S.C. : Banks and Banking </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. : Commerce and Trade </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> U.S.C. sections amended </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> 12 U.S.C. ch. 3 \xa7 226 et seq . </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. ch. 41 \xa7 1601 et seq . </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. ch. 41 \xa7 1693 et seq . </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Legislative history </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> <Ul> <Li> Introduced in the House as H.R. 14279 by Fernand St. Germain ( D - RI ) on October 10 , 1978 </Li> <Li> Committee consideration by House Banking , Finance , and Urban Affairs , Senate Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs </Li> <Li> Passed the House on October 11 , 1978 ( passed ) </Li> <Li> Passed the Senate on October 12 , 1978 ( passed ) with amendment </Li> <Li> House agreed to Senate amendment on October 14 , 1978 ( 341 - 32 , in lieu of H.

It is the specialized function directly associated with the top management . The significance of this function is not seen in the ' Line ' but also in the capacity of the ' Staff ' in overall of a company . It has been defined differently by different experts in the field . </P>\n<P> Form 990 ( officially , the `` Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax '' ) is a United States Internal Revenue Service form that provides the public with financial information about a nonprofit organization . It is often the only source of such information . It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax - exempt status . Certain nonprofits have more comprehensive reporting requirements , such as hospitals and other health care organizations ( Schedule H ) . </P>\n<P> The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , commonly known as the Federal Reserve Board , is the main governing body of the Federal Reserve System . It is charged with overseeing the Federal Reserve Banks and with helping implement monetary policy of the United States . Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14 - year terms . </P>\n<P> The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is an international organization headquartered in Washington , D.C. , of `` 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation , secure financial stability , facilitate international trade , promote high employment and sustainable economic growth , and reduce poverty around the world . '' Formed in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes , it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system . It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises . Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money . As of 2016 , the fund had SDR 477 billion ( about $668 billion ) . </P>\n<Li> Callability -- Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates ; see call option . These bonds are referred to as callable bonds . Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par . With some bonds , the issuer has to pay a premium , the so - called call premium . This is mainly the case for high - yield bonds . These have very strict covenants , restricting the issuer in its operations . To be free from these covenants , the issuer can repay the bonds early , but only at a high cost . </Li>\n<P> On November 7 , 2016 , debt held by the public was $14.3 trillion or about 76 % of the previous 12 months of GDP . Intragovernmental holdings stood at $5.4 trillion , giving a combined total gross national debt of $19.8 trillion or about 106 % of the previous 12 months of GDP ; $6.2 trillion or approximately 45 % of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors , the largest of which were Japan and China at about $1.09 trillion for Japan and $1.06 trillion for China as of December 2016 . </P>\n<P> A currency transaction report ( CTR ) is a report that U.S. financial institutions are required to file with FinCEN for each deposit , withdrawal , exchange of currency , or other payment or transfer , by , through , or to the financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 . Used in this context , currency means the coin and / or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance . Currency also includes U.S. silver certificates , U.S. notes , Federal Reserve notes , and official foreign bank notes . </P>\n<P> Checks and balances is the principle that each of the Branches has the power to limit or check the other two and this creates a balance between the three separate powers of the state , this principle induces that the ambitions of one branch prevent that one of the other branches become supreme , and thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process leaving the people free from government abuses . Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place . This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches . They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight ( co-equal ) , that is , to be balanced , so that they can limit each other , avoiding the abuse of state power . the origin of checks and balances , like separation of powers itself , is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment ( in The Spirit of the Laws , 1748 ) , under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States . </P>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nNon controlling interest on balance sheet refers to the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation.

However , the problems associated with handling a bull ( particularly where cows must be removed from its presence to be worked ) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination ( AI ) of the cows . Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen , where it is kept until it can be sold , at which time it can be very profitable , in fact , many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose . AI is also used to increase the quality of a herd , or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines . Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright . AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds . </P>\n<P> Other than the few bulls needed for breeding , the vast majority of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years , except where they are needed ( castrated ) as work oxen for haulage . Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating , although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef . A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female , and produces proportionately more , leaner muscle . </P>\n<P> Pastoral farming is the major land use but there are increases in land area devoted to horticulture . </P>\n<P> Animal fibers are natural fibers that consist largely of particular proteins . Instances are silk , hair / fur ( including wool ) and feathers . The animal fibers used most commonly both in the manufacturing world as well as by the hand spinners are wool from domestic sheep and silk . Also very popular are alpaca fiber and mohair from Angora goats . Unusual fibers such as Angora wool from rabbits and Chiengora from dogs also exist , but are rarely used for mass production . </P>\n<P> In 2012 , there were 3.2 million farmers , ranchers and other agricultural managers and an estimated 757,900 agricultural workers were legally employed in the US . Animal breeders accounted for 11,500 of those workers with the rest categorized as miscellaneous agricultural workers . The median pay was $9.12 per hour or $18,970 per year . In 2009 , about 519,000 people under age 20 worked on farms owned by their family . In addition to the youth who lived on family farms , an additional 230,000 youth were employed in agriculture . In 2004 , women made up approximately 24 % of farmers ; that year , there were 580,000 women employed in agriculture , forestry , and fishing . </P>\n<P> The recipe can vary widely . The defining ingredients are minced meat ( commonly beef when named cottage pie or lamb when named shepherd 's pie ) , typically cooked in a gravy with onions and sometimes other vegetables , such as peas , celery or carrots , and topped with mashed potato . The pie is sometimes also topped with grated cheese . </P>\n<P> The history of the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC , and the domestication of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia . Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans , and there is evidence of sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period . These sheep were primarily raised for meat , milk , and skins . Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran , and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep 's wool for trading . They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading . </P>\n<P> Although large - scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact , numerous small wheeled artifacts , identified as children 's toys , have been found in Mexican archeological sites , some dating to about 1500 BC . It is thought that the primary obstacle to large - scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages . The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times , the American Bison , is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans ; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago , but ultimately became extinct . The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere , the llama , did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Columbus . </P>\n<P> The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon , Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush , when strong sled dogs were in high demand . The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck . The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley , California , when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska . He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment , where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs . By the end , he sheds the veneer of civilization , and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild . </P>\n<P> The Three Little Pigs was included in The Nursery Rhymes of England ( London and New York , c. 1886 ) , by James Halliwell - Phillipps . The story in its arguably best - known form appeared in English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs , first published in 1890 and crediting Halliwell as his source . The story begins with the title characters being sent out into the world by their mother , to `` seek out their fortune '' . The first little pig builds a house of straw , but a wolf blows it down and devours him . The second little pig builds a house of sticks , which the wolf also blows down , and the second little pig is also devoured . Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases , namely : </P>\n<P> `` How now brown cow '' ( / \u02c8ha\u028a \u02c8na\u028a \u02c8bra\u028an \u02c8ka\u028a / ) is a phrase used in elocution teaching to demonstrate rounded vowel sounds . Each `` ow '' sound in the phrase represents the diphthong / a\u028a / . Although orthographies for each of the four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling `` ow '' , the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the International Phonetic Association 's phonetic alphabet as / a\u028a / is also represented by the spelling `` ou '' . Some examples of these homophonic / a\u028a / 's are the English words `` house '' , `` blouse '' , `` noun '' , and `` cloud '' . The use of the phrase `` how now brown cow '' in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926 . Although not in use today , the phrase `` how now '' is a greeting , short for `` how say you now '' , and can be found in archaic literature , such as the plays of William Shakespeare . </P>\n<P> Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal . The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts , though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally . The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals . As cattle do not have collar bones , these muscles support about 60 % of the body weight of standing / moving cattle . This requires a significant amount of connective tissue , so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue . </P>\n<P> The music to `` Man Gave Names to All the Animals '' is reggae - inspired . The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis , verses 2 : 19 -- 20 in which Adam named the animals and birds . The lyrics have an appeal to children , rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics . So after describing an animal 's `` muddy trail '' and `` curly tail , '' Dylan sings that `` he was n't too small and he was n't too big '' and so that animal was named a pig . Similarly , the cow got its name because Adam `` saw milk comin ' out but he did n't know how '' and the bear got its name because it has a `` great big furry back and furry hair . '' </P>\n<P> As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal ; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway . Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries . They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses , enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously . </P>\n<P> Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology , but rather in the accounts of natural history , for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns , which they believed lived in India , a distant and fabulous realm for them . The earliest description is from Ctesias , who in his book Indika ( `` On India '' ) described them as wild asses , fleet of foot , having a horn a cubit and a half ( 700 mm , 28 inches ) in length , and colored white , red and black . Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one - horned animals , the oryx ( a kind of antelope ) and the so - called `` Indian ass '' . Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one - horned horses with stag - like heads . Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox ( perhaps a rhinoceros ) as one - horned beasts , as well as `` a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag , the feet of the elephant , and the tail of the boar , while the rest of the body is like that of the horse ; it makes a deep lowing noise , and has a single black horn , which projects from the middle of its forehead , two cubits ( 900 mm , 35 inches ) in length . '' In On the Nature of Animals ( \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u0396\u1ff4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f38\u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , De natura animalium ) , Aelian , quoting Ctesias , adds that India produces also a one - horned horse ( iii. 41 ; iv. 52 ) , and says ( xvi. 20 ) that the monoceros ( Greek : \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 ) was sometimes called cartazonos ( Greek : \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) , which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann , meaning `` rhinoceros '' . </P>\n<P> The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west - southwest of Washington , D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . </P>\n<P> Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone . </P>\n<P> Shepherd 's pie or cottage pie is a meat pie with a crust of mashed potato . </P>\n<P> Castles served a range of purposes , the most important of which were military , administrative , and domestic . As well as defensive structures , castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory . Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country 's inhabitants . As William the Conqueror advanced through England , he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken . Between 1066 and 1087 , he established 36 castles such as Warwick Castle , which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands . </P>\n<P> The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show remained in syndicated reruns and was still available for local television stations through The Program Exchange as late as 2016 ; WBBZ - TV , for instance , aired the show in a strip to counterprogram 10 PM newscasts in the Buffalo , New York market during the summer 2013 season . The underlying rights are now owned by Universal Pictures , which holds the library of predecessor companies DreamWorks Animation and Classic Media , and who in turn with copyright holder Ward Productions forms the joint venture Bullwinkle Studios , which manages the Rocky and Bullwinkle properties ; Universal 's purchase of Classic Media coincided with The Program Exchange 's shutdown . </P>\n<P> When Yellowstone National Park was created in 1872 , gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) populations were already in decline in Montana , Wyoming and Idaho . The creation of the national park did not provide protection for wolves or other predators , and government predator control programs in the first decades of the 1900s essentially helped eliminate the gray wolf from Yellowstone . The last wolves were killed in Yellowstone in 1926 . After that time , sporadic reports of wolves still occurred , but scientists confirmed that sustainable wolf populations had been extirpated and were absent from Yellowstone during the mid-1900s . </P>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nBulls are used for breeding and often kept for their semen to sell for AI purposes.

It was the twelfth edition of the Under - 19 Cricket World Cup , and the third to be held in New Zealand ( after the 2002 and 2010 events ) . New Zealand was the first country to host the event three times . The opening ceremony took place on 7 January 2018 . The West Indies were the defending champions . However , they failed to defend their title , after losing their first two group fixtures . </P>\n<P> Scoring over 10,000 runs across a playing career in any format of cricket is considered a significant achievement . In the year 2001 , Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to score 10,000 runs in ODIs , while playing a match during the bi-lateral series against Australia at home . In the chase for achieving top scores , West Indies ' Desmond Haynes retired as the most prolific run - scorer in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) , with a total of 8,648 runs in 1994 . The record stood for four years until it was broken by India 's Mohammed Azharuddin . Azharuddin remained the top - scorer in the format until his compatriot Sachin Tendulkar passed him in October 2000 . As of August 2016 , eleven players -- from six teams that are Full members of the International Cricket Council -- have scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs . Four of these are from Sri Lanka and three from India . The rest are one player each from Pakistan , Australia , West Indies , and South Africa . Bangladesh , England , New Zealand , and Zimbabwe are yet to have a player reach the 10,000 - run mark in this format . </P>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nI'm sorry, I couldn't find any information about who has been honoured with the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World award for 2016.

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that `` the world 's nine nuclear - armed powers and their allies '' neither signed nor supported the treaty - based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty , yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss - Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give `` encouragement to all players in the field '' to disarm . The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty , but drew criticism from those opposed . At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10 , 2017 , Setsuko Thurlow , an 85 - year - old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima , and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture . </P>\n<P> Career records for batting average are usually subject to a minimum qualification of 20 innings played or completed , in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed . Under this qualification , the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia 's Sir Donald Bradman , with 99.94 . Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional , and that only five other players have averages over 60 , this is an outstanding statistic . The fact that Bradman 's average is so far above that of any other cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that , statistically at least , he was the greatest athlete in any sport . </P>\n<Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2017 -- 18 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> South Africa </Td> <Td> India </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Dates </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> 5 January 2018 -- 24 February 2018 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Captains </Th> <Td> Faf du Plessis ( Tests and ODIs ) JP Duminy ( T20Is ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Test series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Result </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> South Africa won the 3 - match series 2 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> AB de Villiers ( 211 ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli ( 286 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Vernon Philander ( 15 ) Kagiso Rabada ( 15 ) </Td> <Td> Mohammed Shami ( 15 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Vernon Philander ( SA ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> One Day International series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Results </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> India won the 6 - match series 5 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> Hashim Amla ( 154 ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli ( 558 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Lungi Ngidi ( 8 ) </Td> <Td> Kuldeep Yadav ( 17 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Virat Kohli ( Ind ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Twenty20 International series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Results </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> India won the 3 - match series 2 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> JP Duminy ( 122 ) </Td> <Td> Shikhar Dhawan ( 143 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Junior Dala ( 7 ) </Td> <Td> Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( 7 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( Ind ) </Td> </Tr> </Table>\n<P> Brian Lara took the least number of innings ( 195 ) to reach the 10,000 run mark , later equalled by Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara , while Australia 's Steve Waugh took 244 innings to achieve the feat .

Taussig of USS Bennington landed on Wake and formally took possession of the island for the United States . After a 21 - gun salute , the flag was raised and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription : </P>\n<Li> 1960 Flag with 50 stars ( Hawaii ) </Li>\n<P> The flag of the United States of America , often referred to as the American flag , is the national flag of the United States . It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red ( top and bottom ) alternating with white , with a blue rectangle in the canton ( referred to specifically as the `` union '' ) bearing fifty small , white , five - pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows , where rows of six stars ( top and bottom ) alternate with rows of five stars . The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America , and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain , and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes , Old Glory , and The Star - Spangled Banner . </P>\n<P> The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America . It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch , a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools . The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 , and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942 . The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 . The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day in 1954 , when the words `` under God '' were added . </P>\n<P> In modern times , the U.S. military plays ( or sounds ) `` Reveille '' in the morning , generally near sunrise , though its exact time varies from base to base . On U.S. Army posts and Air Force bases , `` Reveille '' is played by itself or followed by the bugle call `` To the Colors '' at which time the national flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel outdoors are required to come to attention and present a salute in uniform , either to the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible . While in formation , soldiers are brought to the position of parade rest while `` Reveille '' plays then called to attention and present arms as the national flag is raised . On board U.S. Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard facilities , the flag is generally raised at 0800 ( 8 am ) while `` The Star Spangled Banner '' or the bugle call `` To the Colors '' is played . On some U.S. military bases , `` Reveille '' is accompanied by a cannon shot . </P>\n<P> When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart . After 9 / 11 , the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal . </P>\n<P> A flag designed by John McConnell in 1969 for the first Earth Day is a dark blue field charged with The Blue Marble , a famous NASA photo of the Earth as seen from outer space . The first edition of McConnell 's flag used screen - printing and used different colors : ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white . McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration . </P>\n<P> The torch - bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , of the New York World , started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was built in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker - tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . </P>\n<P> The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay , based on the U.S flag , where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies . The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes ; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance . The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810 ; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santill\xe1n , the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti , the sun god of the Inca religion . It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia . </P>\n<P> The anthem has been recorded and performed in many different languages , usually as a result of the hosting of either form of the Games in various countries . The IOC does n't require that the anthem be performed in either English or Greek . But in the 2008 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Beijing , China , Greek was sung instead of the host country 's official language , Mandarin . Also in the 2016 Olympic opening ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , English was also sung instead of host country 's official language , Portuguese . </P>\n<P> The United States Oath of Allegiance , officially referred to as the `` Oath of Allegiance , '' 8 C.F.R. Part 337 ( 2008 ) , is an allegiance oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens . </P>\n<P> During the first half of the 19th century , seven stars were added to the flag to represent the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence , being the provinces of Caracas , Cuman\xe1 , Barcelona , Barinas , Margarita , M\xe9rida , and Trujillo . </P>\n<P> With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of Guam and the Philippines during the Spanish -- American War that same year , the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island , located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila , as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships . On July 4 , 1898 , United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade , Philippine Expeditionary Force , of the Eighth Army Corps , stopped at Wake Island and raised the American flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS China . </P>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nI don't have the answer with the provided context.

You must follow the formats below to write your code:\n```language\n# your code\n```\n\nUser\'s question is: How can I use FLAML to perform a classification task and use spark to do parallel training. Train 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Research\n\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n\n- [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

Train for 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Research\n\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n\n- [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Research\n\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n\n- [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nragproxyagent (to assistant):\n\nYou\'re a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately.

Alongside this move, we have also launched a dedicated [Discord](https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ) server and a [website](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) for comprehensive documentation.\n\n:fire: The automated multi-agent chat framework in [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is in preview from v2.0.0.\n\n:fire: FLAML is highlighted in OpenAI's [cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook#related-resources-from-around-the-web).\n\n:fire: [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is released with support for ChatGPT and GPT-4, based on [Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673).\n\n:fire: FLAML supports Code-First AutoML & Tuning \u2013 Private Preview in [Microsoft Fabric Data Science](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/).\n\n## What is FLAML\n\nFLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\nlearning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\nand optimizes their performance.\n\n- FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\n- For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\n- It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\n\nFLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\n\nFLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\n\n## Installation\n\nFLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\n\n```bash\npip install flaml\n```\n\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package.\n\n```bash\npip install \"flaml[autogen]\"\n```\n\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).\nEach of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n- (New) The [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.\n  It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.\n  By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import autogen\n\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\"assistant\")\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(\n    assistant,\n    message=\"Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.\",\n)\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\n```\n\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.\n\n```python\n# perform tuning\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\n    data=tune_data,\n    metric=\"success\",\n    mode=\"max\",\n    eval_func=eval_func,\n    inference_budget=0.05,\n    optimization_budget=3,\n    num_samples=-1,\n)\n# perform inference for a test instance\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\n```\n\n- With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast\n  AutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import AutoML\n\nautoml = AutoML()\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\")\n```\n\n- You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning\n  tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).\n\n```python\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\", estimator_list=[\"lgbm\"])\n```\n\n- You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import tune\ntune.run(evaluation_function, config={\u2026}, low_cost_partial_config={\u2026}, time_budget_s=3600)\n```\n\n- [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.\n\n```python\nfrom flaml.default import LGBMRegressor\n\n# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.\nestimator = LGBMRegressor()\n# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.\nestimator.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find a detailed documentation about FLAML [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/).\n\nIn addition, you can find:\n\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research) and [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/blog) around FLAML.\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cppx2vSPVP).\n\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Contribute).\n\n- ML.NET documentation and tutorials for [Model Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/predict-prices-with-model-builder), [ML.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-cli), and [AutoML API](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/how-to-use-the-automl-api).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

However, FLAML does offer general hyperparameter tuning capabilities which could be related to this. In the context of FLAML, there is a generic function called `tune.run()` that can be used for hyperparameter tuning.\n\nHere's a short example of how to use FLAML's tune for a user-defined function based on the given context:\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import tune\n\ndef evaluation_function(config):\n    # evaluation logic that returns a metric score\n    ...\n\n# define the search space for hyperparameters\nconfig_search_space = {\n    'max_depth': tune.randint(lower=3, upper=10),\n    'learning_rate': tune.loguniform(lower=1e-4, upper=1e-1),\n}\n\n# run hyperparameter tuning\ntune.run(\n    evaluation_function,\n    config=config_search_space,\n    low_cost_partial_config={'max_depth': 3},\n    time_budget_s=3600\n)\n```\n\nPlease note that if you are referring to a different kind of function or use case, you might need to specify more details or check the official documentation or source code of the FLAML library.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nragproxyagent (to assistant):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to ragproxyagent):\n\nUPDATE CONTEXT\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdating context and resetting conversation.\nAdding content of doc 0ecd7192-3761-7d6f-9151-5ff504ca740b to context.\nAdding content of doc ddbaaafc-abdd-30b4-eecd-ec2c32818952 to context.\nragproxyagent (to assistant):\n\nYou're a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

If `yfinance` is not installed, it can be installed using pip: `pip install yfinance`.\n\nHere is the Python code to fetch the stock prices and calculate the year-to-date gain:\n\n```python\n# Python code\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Get the current year\ncurrent_year = datetime.now().year\n\n# Download stock data for the current year\nmeta_data = yf.download('FB', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)\ntesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)\n\n# Calculate the year-to-date gain for each stock\nmeta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100\ntesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100\n\n# Print the year-to-date gain for each stock\nprint(f'META year-to-date gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')\nprint(f'TESLA year-to-date gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')\n```\n\nThis code fetches the closing prices for META and TESLA for the current year, calculates the year-to-date gain for each stock, and prints the results. The year-to-date gain is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price from the first trading day of the year to the most recent trading day.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING 2 CODE BLOCKS (inferred languages are [python, python])...\nuser_proxy (to assistant):\n\nexitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: Today's date: 2024-04-12\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/ekzhu/autogen/notebook/coding/tmp_code_cb9ef30baa23cf28e127198c0ebeb7e6.py\", line 9, in <module>\n    meta_data = yf.download('FB', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)\n                                                                     ^^^^^\nNameError: name 'today' is not defined\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nI apologize for the oversight.

Two companies that stood out during this period were META and TESLA. \n\nMETA, the social media giant, had an average stock price of [META Mean] during this period. The highest it reached was [META Max], while the lowest was [META Min]. The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the prices were, was [META Std].\n\nOn the other hand, TESLA, the electric vehicle and clean energy company, had an average stock price of [TESLA Mean]. The stock reached a high of [TESLA Max] and a low of [TESLA Min]. The standard deviation for TESLA was [TESLA Std].\n\nThese figures show that both META and TESLA had their ups and downs during this period. However, the higher standard deviation for [Company with higher Std] indicates that its stock price fluctuated more compared to [Company with lower Std].\n\nAs we move further into 2024, it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve. Will META and TESLA continue on their current trajectories, or will we see a shift in the market dynamics? Only time will tell.\n\n---\n\nPlease replace [META Mean], [META Max], [META Min], [META Std], [TESLA Mean], [TESLA Max], [TESLA Min], [TESLA Std], [Company with higher Std], and [Company with lower Std] with the actual values obtained from the Python code.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy (to assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: META - Mean: 403.53000895182294, Max: 519.8300170898438, Min: 344.4700012207031, Std: 100.72287240911488\nTESLA - Mean: 219.54332987467447, Max: 248.4199981689453, Min: 171.75999450683594, Std: 41.68075797345465\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nGreat!

Then, it defines the main function `count_primes(end)` to count the number of prime numbers up to `end`. Finally, it prints the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.\n\nTo run the script, save it to a file named `count_primes.py`, and then execute it using the command `python count_primes.py` in a terminal or command prompt. The script will print the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues or errors when running the script.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\nUser (to DBRX Assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: 1229\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDBRX Assistant (to User):\n\nGreat! The execution succeeded and the output is 1229, which is the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000. This means that there are 1229 prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000.\n\nTo verify the result, we can manually check the prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000. Here are the first few prime numbers:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199,...\n\nWe can see that there are indeed 1229 prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000.\n\nTherefore, the output of the script is correct and the task is solved.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"Provide feedback to DBRX Assistant.

I\'m glad you asked about the relationship between deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDeep learning is actually a subset of AI, which is a broader field dedicated to creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Other subsets of AI include rule-based systems, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among others.\n\nDeep learning, on the other hand, is a specific approach to building AI systems that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In deep learning, we use artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons," to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n\nDeep learning has been particularly successful in recent years due to several factors, including the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computational resources, and advances in neural network architectures and training algorithms. As a result, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n\nSo, in summary, deep learning is a specific approach to building AI systems that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to its impressive performance on a variety of tasks. However, it is just one of many approaches to building AI systems, and it is important to understand the broader context of AI in order to fully appreciate the potential and limitations of deep learning.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"implement-logging-display",children:"Implement Logging Display"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It can be useful to display chat logs to the notebook for debugging, and\nthen persist those logs to a Delta table.

A founder of Studio Ghibli, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\nBorn in Tokyo City in the Empire of Japan, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver\'s Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978). He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature film The Castle of Cagliostro as well as the television series Sherlock Hound. In the same period, he began writing and illustrating the manga Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind (1982\u20131994) and directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.\nMiyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films with Ghibli, including Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki\'s Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). The films were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki\'s film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film ever to win the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli\'s popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 21st century. Miyazaki\'s later films\u2014Howl\'s Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)\u2014also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he later returned to write and direct his twelfth feature film The Boy and the Heron (2023), for which he won his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\nMiyazaki\'s works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity\'s relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki\'s works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother\'s company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II. The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki\'s early life. Miyazaki\'s father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic understanding. He said that he was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940; after declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight because of his wife and young child, he was discharged after a lecture about disloyalty. According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about his exploits, claiming that he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki died on March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt that he had often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said anything "lofty or inspiring". He regretted not having a serious discussion with his father, and felt that he had inherited his "anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing contradictions".\n\nMiyazaki has noted that some of his earliest memories are of "bombed-out cities". In 1944, when he was three years old, Miyazaki\'s family evacuated to Utsunomiya. After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, he and his family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four. As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told that he would not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast. From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki\'s mother Yoshiko suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital before being nursed from home. Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned "socially accepted norms". She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a strong influence on him and his later work. Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72.\nMiyazaki began school in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the first through third grades. After his family moved back to Suginami-ku, Miyazaki completed the fourth grade at \u014cmiya Elementary School, and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was newly established after splitting off from \u014cmiya Elementary. After graduating from Eifuku as part of the first graduating class, he attended \u014cmiya Junior High School. He aspired to become a manga artist, but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he only drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years. Miyazaki was influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji Yamakawa and Osamu Tezuka. Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was "bad form" to copy Tezuka\'s style as it was hindering his own development as an artist. Around this time, Miyazaki would often see movies with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include Meshi (1951) and Tasogare Sakaba (1955).\nAfter graduating from \u014cmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School. During his third and final year, Miyazaki\'s interest in animation was sparked by Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), Japan\'s first feature-length animated film in color; he had sneaked out to watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams. Miyazaki later recounted that he fell in love with the film\'s heroine, Bai-Niang, and that the film moved him to tears and left a profound impression; he wrote that he was "moved to the depths of [his] soul" and that the "pure, earnest world of the film" affirmed a side of him that "yearned desperately to affirm the world rather than negate it". After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University in the department of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory. He joined the "Children\'s Literature Research Club", the "closest thing back then to a comics club"; he was sometimes the sole member of the club. In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in his studio, where the two would drink and "talk about politics, life, all sorts of things". Around this time, he also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to rent their stories. In 1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing photographs in Asahi Graph; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations. Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nIn 1963, Miyazaki was employed at Toei Animation; this was the last year the company hired regularly. After gaining employment, he began renting a four-and-a-half tatami (7.4 m2; 80 sq ft) apartment in Nerima, Tokyo; the rent was \xa56,000. His salary at Toei was \xa519,500. Miyazaki worked as an in-between artist on the theatrical feature anime Doggie March and the television anime Wolf Boy Ken (both 1963). He also worked on Gulliver\'s Travels Beyond the Moon (1965). He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, and became chief secretary of Toei\'s labor union in 1964. Miyazaki later worked as chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968). Throughout the film\'s production, Miyazaki worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo \u014ctsuka, whose approach to animation profoundly influenced Miyazaki\'s work. Directed by Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki would continue to collaborate for the remainder of his career, the film was highly praised, and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation. Miyazaki moved to a residence in \u014cizumigakuench\u014d in April 1969, after the birth of his second son.\nMiyazaki provided key animation for The Wonderful World of Puss \'n Boots (1969), directed by Kimio Yabuki. He created a 12-chapter manga series as a promotional tie-in for the film; the series ran in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1969. Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for Flying Phantom Ship (1969), in which military tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the scenes. Under the pseudonym Akitsu Sabur\u014d (\u79cb\u6d25 \u4e09\u6717), Miyazaki wrote and illustrated the manga People of the Desert, published in 26 installments between September 1969 and March 1970 in Boys and Girls Newspaper (\u5c11\u5e74\u5c11\u5973\u65b0\u805e, Sh\u014dnen sh\u014djo shinbun). He was influenced by illustrated stories such as Fukushima\'s Evil Lord of the Desert (\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b, Sabaku no ma\u014d). In 1970, Miyazaki moved residence to Tokorozawa. In 1971, he developed structure, characters and designs for Hiroshi Ikeda\'s adaptation of Animal Treasure Island; he created the 13-part manga adaptation, printed in Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1971. Miyazaki also provided key animation for Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.\nMiyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, and was hired at A-Pro, where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 23 episodes of Lupin the Third Part I, often using the pseudonym Teruki Tsutomu (\u7167\u6a39 \u52d9). The two also began pre-production on a series based on Astrid Lindgren\'s Pippi Longstocking books, designing extensive storyboards; the series was canceled after Miyazaki and Takahata were unable to meet with Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project. In 1972 and 1973, Miyazaki wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda! shorts, directed by Takahata. After moving from A-Pro to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d in June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata worked on World Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animation series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri\'s Heidi. Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d continued as Nippon Animation in July 1975. Miyazaki also directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978), an adaptation of Alexander Key\'s The Incredible Tide.\n\n\n=== Breakthrough films ===\nMiyazaki left Nippon Animation in 1979, during the production of Anne of Green Gables; he provided scene design and organization on the first fifteen episodes. He moved to Telecom Animation Film, a subsidiary of TMS Entertainment, to direct his first feature anime film, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a Lupin III film. In his role at Telecom, Miyazaki helped train the second wave of employees. Miyazaki directed six episodes of Sherlock Hound in 1981, until issues with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s estate led to a suspension in production; Miyazaki was busy with other projects by the time the issues were resolved, and the remaining episodes were directed by Kyosuke Mikuriya. They were broadcast from November 1984 to May 1985. Miyazaki also wrote the graphic novel The Journey of Shuna, inspired by the Tibetan folk tale "Prince who became a dog". The novel was published by Tokuma Shoten in June 1983, dramatized for radio broadcast in 1987, and published in English as Shuna\'s Journey in 2022. Hayao Miyazaki\'s Daydream Data Notes was also irregularly published from November 1984 to October 1994 in Model Graphix; selections of the stories received radio broadcast in 1995.\nAfter the release of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of Richard Corben\'s comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: Warring States Demon Castle (\u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce, Sengoku ma-j\u014d), to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben\'s Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film. The manga\u2014titled Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind\u2014ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tank\u014dbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia-toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.\n\nFollowing the completion of Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind\'s first two volumes, Suzuki and the other editors of Animage encouraged Miyazaki to work on a film adaptation; some documentaries claim he began writing the manga after his film pitch was rejected, but Miyazaki said the manga came first. Miyazaki\'s imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film\'s polluted world. By this time, Miyazaki had moved to the animation studio Topcraft and was finding some of the staff to be unreliable. He eventually decided to bring on several of his previous collaborators for the film\'s production, including Takahata who would serve as producer. Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with. Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film\'s score. Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind was released on March 11, 1984. It grossed \xa51.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional \xa5742 million in distribution income. It is often seen as Miyazaki\'s pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator. It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly that of main character Nausica\xe4. Several critics have labeled Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating that he only wishes to entertain. The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki opened his own office in Suginami Ward, naming it Nibariki.\n\n\n=== Studio Ghibli ===\n\n\n==== Early films (1985\u20131996) ====\nOn June 15, 1985, Miyazaki and Takahata founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli as a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten. Studio Ghibli\'s first film was Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), directed by Miyazaki. Some of the architecture in the film was also inspired by a Welsh mining town; Miyazaki witnessed the mining strike upon his first visit to Wales in 1984 and admired the miners\' dedication to their work and community. Laputa was released on August 2, 1986, by the Toei Company. It sold around 775,000 tickets; Miyazaki and Suzuki expressed their disappointment with the film\'s box office figures. Miyazaki\'s following film, My Neighbor Totoro, was released alongside Takahata\'s Grave of the Fireflies in April 1988 to ensure Studio Ghibli\'s financial status. My Neighbor Totoro features the theme of the relationship between the environment and humanity, showing that harmony is the result of respecting the environment. While the film received critical acclaim, it was commercially unsuccessful at the box office. However, merchandising was successful, and the film was labeled as a cult classic.\nIn 1987, Studio Ghibli acquired the rights to create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono\'s novel Kiki\'s Delivery Service. Miyazaki\'s work on My Neighbor Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director, and Nobuyuki Isshiki was hired as script writer. Miyazaki\'s dissatisfaction of Isshiki\'s first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono was unhappy with the differences between the book and the screenplay. Miyazaki and Suzuki visited Kadono and invited her to the studio; she allowed the project to continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Kiki\'s Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989. It earned \xa52.15 billion at the box office, and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.\nFrom March to May 1989, Miyazaki\'s manga Hik\u014dtei Jidai was published in the magazine Model Graphix. Miyazaki began production on a 45-minute in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on the manga; Suzuki ultimately extended the film into the feature-length film, titled Porco Rosso, as expectations grew. The outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in 1991 affected Miyazaki, prompting a more sombre tone for the film; Miyazaki would later refer to the film as "foolish", as its mature tones were unsuitable for children. The film featured anti-war themes, which Miyazaki would later revisit. The airline remained a major investor in the film, resulting in its initial premiere as an in-flight film, prior to its theatrical release on July 18, 1992. The film was commercially successful and remained one of the highest-grossing films in Japan for several years.\nStudio Ghibli set up its headquarters in Koganei, Tokyo in August 1992. In November 1992, two television spots directed by Miyazaki were broadcast by Nippon Television Network (NTV): Sora Iro no Tane, a 90-second spot adapted from the illustrated story Sora Iro no Tane by Rieko Nakagawa and Yuriko Omura; and Nandarou, a series of five advertisements featuring an undefinable creature. Miyazaki designed the storyboards and wrote the screenplay for Whisper of the Heart (1995), directed by Yoshifumi Kond\u014d.\n\n\n==== Global emergence (1997\u20132008) ====\nMiyazaki began work on the initial storyboards for Princess Mononoke in August 1994, based on preliminary thoughts and sketches from the late 1970s. While experiencing writer\'s block during production, Miyazaki accepted a request for the creation of On Your Mark, a music video for the song of the same name by Chage and Aska. In the production of the video, Miyazaki experimented with computer animation to supplement traditional animation. On Your Mark premiered as a short before Whisper of the Heart. Despite the video\'s popularity, Suzuki said that it was not given "100 percent" focus.\n\nIn May 1995, Miyazaki took a group of artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of \xa52.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive Japanese animated film at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film\'s frames, time constraints doubled this, though it remained below ten percent of the final film.\nUpon its premiere on July 12, 1997, Princess Mononoke was critically acclaimed, becoming the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year. The film was also commercially successful, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan for several months. Miramax Films purchased the film\'s distributions rights for North America; while it was largely unsuccessful at the box office, grossing about US$2.3 million, it was seen as the introduction of Studio Ghibli to global markets. Miyazaki claimed Princess Mononoke would be his final film. Tokuma Shoten merged with Studio Ghibli in June 1997. Miyazaki left Studio Ghibli on January 14, 1998, to create a new studio called Butaya, to be succeeded by Kond\u014d; however, Kond\u014d\'s death impacted Miyazaki, and he returned to Studio Ghibli on January 16, 1999.\nMiyazaki\'s next film was conceived while on vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five young girls who were family friends. Miyazaki realized that he had not created a film for 10-year-old girls, and set out to do so. He read sh\u014dj\u014d manga magazines like Nakayoshi and Ribon for inspiration, but felt they only offered subjects on "crushes and romance", which is not what the girls "held dear in their hearts". He decided to produce the film about a female heroine whom they could look up to. Production of the film, titled Spirited Away, commenced in 2000 on a budget of \xa51.9 billion (US$15 million). As with Princess Mononoke, the staff experimented with computer animation, but kept the technology at a level to enhance the story, not to "steal the show". Spirited Away deals with symbols of human greed, symbolizing the 1980s Japanese asset price bubble, and a liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The film was released on July 20, 2001; it received critical acclaim, and is considered among the greatest films of the 2000s. It won the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was also commercially successful, earning \xa530.4 billion (US$289.1 million) at the box office. It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, a record it maintained for almost 20 years. Following the death of Tokuma in September 2000, Miyazaki served as the head of his funeral committee.\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of Howl\'s Moving Castle, based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones. Mamoru Hosoda of Toei Animation was originally selected to direct the film, but disagreements between Hosoda and Studio Ghibli executives led to the project\'s abandonment. After six months, Studio Ghibli resurrected the project. Miyazaki was inspired to direct the film upon reading Jones\' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside; the novel does not explain how the castle moved, which led to Miyazaki\'s designs. He traveled to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the film\'s setting. Additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in Albert Robida\'s work. It was released on November 20, 2004, and received widespread critical acclaim. The film received the Osella Award for Technical Excellence at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In Japan, the film grossed a record $14.5 million in its first week of release. It remains among the highest-grossing films in Japan, with a worldwide gross of over \xa519.3 billion. Miyazaki received the honorary Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement award at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival in 2005.\nIn March 2005, Studio Ghibli split from Tokuma Shoten. In the 1980s, Miyazaki had contacted Ursula K. Le Guin expressing interest in producing an adaptation of her Earthsea novels; unaware of Miyazaki\'s work, Le Guin declined. Upon watching My Neighbor Totoro several years later, Le Guin expressed approval to the concept of the adaptation. She met with Suzuki in August 2005, who wanted Miyazaki\'s son Goro to direct the film, as Miyazaki had wished to retire. Disappointed that Miyazaki was not directing, but under the impression that he would supervise his son\'s work, Le Guin approved of the film\'s production. Miyazaki later publicly opposed and criticized Gor\u014d\'s appointment as director. Upon Miyazaki\'s viewing of the film, he wrote a message for his son: "It was made honestly, so it was good".\nMiyazaki designed the covers for several manga novels in 2006, including A Trip to Tynemouth; he also worked as editor, and created a short manga for the book. Miyazaki\'s next film, Ponyo, began production in May 2006. It was initially inspired by "The Little Mermaid" by Hans Christian Andersen, though began to take its own form as production continued. Miyazaki aimed for the film to celebrate the innocence and cheerfulness of a child\'s universe. He intended for it to only use traditional animation, and was intimately involved with the artwork. He preferred to draw the sea and waves himself, as he enjoyed experimenting. Ponyo features 170,000 frames\u2014a record for Miyazaki. The film\'s seaside village was inspired by Tomonoura, a town in Setonaikai National Park, where Miyazaki stayed in 2005. The main character, S\u014dsuke, is based on Gor\u014d. Following its release on July 19, 2008, Ponyo was critically acclaimed, receiving Animation of the Year at the 32nd Japan Academy Film Prize. The film was also a commercial success, earning \xa510 billion (US$93.2 million) in its first month and \xa515.5 billion by the end of 2008, placing it among the highest-grossing films in Japan.\n\n\n==== Later films (2009\u2013present) ====\n\nIn early 2009, Miyazaki began writing a manga called Kaze Tachinu (\u98a8\u7acb\u3061\u306c, The Wind Rises), telling the story of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter designer Jiro Horikoshi. The manga was first published in two issues of the Model Graphix magazine, published on February 25 and March 25, 2009. Miyazaki later co-wrote the screenplay for Arrietty (2010) and From Up on Poppy Hill (2011), directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Gor\u014d Miyazaki respectively. Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to Ponyo, but Suzuki convinced him to instead adapt Kaze Tachinu to film. In November 2012, Studio Ghibli announced the production of The Wind Rises, based on Kaze Tachinu, to be released alongside Takahata\'s The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\nMiyazaki was inspired to create The Wind Rises after reading a quote from Horikoshi: "All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful". Several scenes in The Wind Rises were inspired by Tatsuo Hori\'s novel The Wind Has Risen (\u98a8\u7acb\u3061\u306c), in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fianc\xe9e before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character\'s name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori\'s novel Naoko (\u83dc\u7a42\u5b50). The Wind Rises continues to reflect Miyazaki\'s pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not the intention of the film. The film premiered on July 20, 2013, and received critical acclaim; it was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Film Prize, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was also commercially successful, grossing \xa511.6 billion (US$110 million) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.\nIn September 2013, Miyazaki announced that he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on the displays at the Studio Ghibli Museum. Miyazaki was awarded the Academy Honorary Award at the Governors Awards in November 2014. He developed Boro the Caterpillar, an animated short film which was first discussed during pre-production for Princess Mononoke. It was screened exclusively at the Studio Ghibli Museum in July 2017. Around this time, Miyazaki was working on a manga titled Teppo Samurai. In February 2019, a four-part documentary was broadcast on the NHK network titled 10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki, documenting production of his films in his private studio. In 2019, Miyazaki approved a musical adaptation of Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind, as it was performed by a kabuki troupe.\nIn August 2016, Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, Kimi-tachi wa D\u014d Ikiru ka (titled The Boy and the Heron in English), on which he began animation work without receiving official approval. The film opened in Japanese theaters on July 14, 2023. It was preceded by a minimal marketing campaign, forgoing trailers, commercials, and advertisements, a response from Suzuki to his perceived oversaturation of marketing materials in mainstream films. Despite claims that The Boy and the Heron would be Miyazaki\'s final film, Studio Ghibli vice president Junichi Nishioka said in September 2023 that Miyazaki continued to attend the office daily to plan his next film. Suzuki said he could no longer convince Miyazaki to retire. The Boy and the Heron won Miyazaki his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards, becoming the oldest director to do so; Miyazaki did not attend the show due to his advanced age.\n\n\n== Views ==\n\nMiyazaki has often criticized the state of the animation industry, stating that some animators lack a foundational understanding of their subjects and do not prioritize realism. He is particularly critical of Japanese animation, saying that anime is "produced by humans who can\'t stand looking at other humans ... that\'s why the industry is full of otaku\u200a!". He has frequently criticized otaku, including "fanatics" of guns and fighter aircraft, declaring it a "fetish" and refusing to identify himself as such. He bemoaned the state of Disney animated films in 1988, saying "they show nothing but contempt for the audience".\nIn 2013, Miyazaki criticized Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\'s policies and the proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow Abe to revise the clause outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes. Miyazaki felt Abe wished to "leave his name in history as a great man who revised the Constitution and its interpretation", describing it as "despicable" and stating "People who don\'t think enough shouldn\'t meddle with the constitution". In 2015, Miyazaki disapproved Abe\'s denial of Japan\'s military aggression, stating Japan "should clearly say that [they] inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it". He felt the government should give a "proper apology" to Korean comfort women who were forced to service the Japanese army during World War II and suggested the Senkaku Islands be "split in half" or controlled by both Japan and China. After the release of The Wind Rises in 2013, some online critics labeled Miyazaki a "traitor" and "anti-Japanese", describing the film as overly "left-wing"; Miyazaki recognized leftist values in his movies, citing his influence by and appreciation of communism as defined by Karl Marx, but criticized the Soviet Union\'s political system.\nIn 2003, Miyazaki refused to attend the 75th Academy Awards in Hollywood in protest of the United States\'s involvement in the Iraq War, and later said he "didn\'t want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq". He did not publicly express this opinion at the request of his producer until 2009 when he lifted his boycott and attended San Diego Comic Con International as a favor to his friend John Lasseter. Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, criticizing the magazine\'s decision to publish the content cited as the catalyst for the incident; he felt caricatures should be made of politicians, not cultures. In November 2016, Miyazaki stated that he believed "many of the people who voted for Brexit and Trump" were affected by the increase in unemployment due to companies "building cars in Mexico because of low wages and [selling] them in the US". He did not think that Donald Trump would be elected president, calling it "a terrible thing", and said that Trump\'s political opponent Hillary Clinton was "terrible as well".\n\n\n== Themes ==\nMiyazaki\'s works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, love, and family. His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist; Miyazaki felt Spirited Away\'s Chihiro "manages not because she has destroyed the \'evil\', but because she has acquired the ability to survive".\nMiyazaki\'s films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth\'s fragility. Margaret Talbot stated that Miyazaki dislikes modern technology, and believes much of modern culture is "thin and shallow and fake"; he anticipates a time with "no more high-rises". Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Sh\u014dwa period from 1955 to 1965 because "nature\u2014the mountains and rivers\u2014was being destroyed in the name of economic progress". Peter Schellhase of The Imaginative Conservative identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki\'s films "attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization". Miyazaki is critical of exploitation under both communism and capitalism, as well as globalization and its effects on modern life, believing that "a company is common property of the people that work there". Ram Prakash Dwivedi identified values of Mahatma Gandhi in the films of Miyazaki.\nSeveral of Miyazaki\'s films feature anti-war themes. Daisuke Akimoto of Animation Studies categorized Porco Rosso as "anti-war propaganda" and felt the protagonist, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism. Akimoto also argues that The Wind Rises reflects Miyazaki\'s "antiwar pacifism", despite the latter stating that the film does not attempt to "denounce" war. Schellhase also identifies Princess Mononoke as a pacifist film due to the protagonist, Ashitaka; instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind, as his ethnic history would lead him to do, Ashitaka strives for peace. David Loy and Linda Goodhew argue that both Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke do not depict traditional evil, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will, and delusion; according to Buddhism, the roots of evil must transform into "generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom" in order to overcome suffering, and both Nausica\xe4 and Ashitaka accomplish this. When characters in Miyazaki\'s films are forced to engage in violence, it is shown as being a difficult task; in Howl\'s Moving Castle, Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves, and it almost destroys him, though he is ultimately saved by Sophie\'s love and bravery.\nSuzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as "brave, self-sufficient girls that don\'t think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart", stating that they may "need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour" and that "any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man". Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly protagonist Nausica\xe4. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki\'s films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a "coming of age" element for the heroines in Miyazaki\'s films, as they each discover "individual personality and strengths". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki "shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman". In particular, Bellot cites Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film\'s challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausica\xe4. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononoke\'s San represents the "conflict between selfhood and expression".\nMiyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people, seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films. Michael Toscano of Curator found that Miyazaki "fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan\'s native animism". Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazaki\'s works feature themes of love and romance, but felt emphasis is placed on "the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them". He also found that many of the protagonists in Miyazaki\'s films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional.\n\n\n== Creation process and influences ==\nMiyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing the film\'s narrative as he designs the storyboards. "We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops," he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to "enrich the visual look", though he ensures that each film can "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D". He oversees every frame of his films. For character designs, Miyazaki draws original drafts used by animation directors to create reference sheets, which are then corrected by Miyazaki in his style.\nMiyazaki has cited several Japanese artists as his influences, including Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Soji Yamakawa, and Isao Takahata. A number of Western authors have also influenced his works, including Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Back, Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Jean Giraud, Paul Grimault, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Yuri Norstein, as well as animation studio Aardman Animations (specifically the works of Nick Park). Specific works that have influenced Miyazaki include Animal Farm (1945), The Snow Queen (1957), and The King and the Mockingbird (1980); The Snow Queen is said to be the true catalyst for Miyazaki\'s filmography, influencing his training and work. When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends\' children, as well as memories of his own childhood.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMiyazaki married fellow animator Akemi \u014cta in October 1965; the two had met while colleagues at Toei Animation. The couple have two sons: Goro, born in January 1967, and Keisuke, born in April 1969. Miyazaki felt that becoming a father changed him, as he tried to produce work that would please his children. Miyazaki initially fulfilled a promise to his wife that they would both continue to work after Goro\'s birth, dropping him off at preschool for the day; however, upon seeing Goro\'s exhaustion walking home one day, Miyazaki decided that they could not continue, and his wife stayed at home to raise their children. Miyazaki\'s dedication to his work harmed his relationship with his children, as he was often absent. Goro watched his father\'s works in an attempt to "understand" him, since the two rarely talked. Miyazaki said that he "tried to be a good father, but in the end [he] wasn\'t a very good parent". During the production of Tales from Earthsea in 2006, Goro said that his father "gets zero marks as a father but full marks as a director of animated films".\nGoro worked at a landscape design firm before beginning to work at the Ghibli Museum; he designed the garden on its rooftop and eventually became its curator. Keisuke studied forestry at Shinshu University and works as a wood artist; he designed a woodcut print that appears in Whisper of the Heart. Miyazaki\'s niece, Mei Okuyama, who was the inspiration behind the character Mei in My Neighbor Totoro, is married to animation artist Daisuke Tsutsumi.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMiyazaki was described as the "godfather of animation in Japan" by BBC\'s Tessa Wong in 2016, citing his craftsmanship and humanity, the themes of his films, and his inspiration to younger artists. Courtney Lanning of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette named him one of the world\'s greatest animators, comparing him to Osamu Tezuka and Walt Disney. Swapnil Dhruv Bose of Far Out Magazine wrote that Miyazaki\'s work "has shaped not only the future of animation but also filmmaking in general", and that it helped "generation after generation of young viewers to observe the magic that exists in the mundane". Richard James Havis of South China Morning Post called him a "genius ... who sets exacting standards for himself, his peers and studio staff". Paste\'s Toussaint Egan described Miyazaki as "one of anime\'s great auteurs", whose "stories of such singular thematic vision and unmistakable aesthetic" captured viewers otherwise unfamiliar with anime. Miyazaki became the subject of an exhibit at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in 2021, featuring over 400 objects from his films.\nMiyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration to numerous animators, directors and writers around the world, including Wes Anderson, James Cameron, Dean DeBlois, Guillermo del Toro, Pete Docter, Mamoru Hosoda, Bong Joon-ho, Travis Knight, John Lasseter, Nick Park, Henry Selick, Makoto Shinkai, and Steven Spielberg. Glen Keane said Miyazaki is a "huge influence" on Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been "part of our heritage" ever since The Rescuers Down Under (1990). The Disney Renaissance era was also prompted by competition with the development of Miyazaki\'s films. Artists from Pixar and Aardman Studios signed a tribute stating, "You\'re our inspiration, Miyazaki-san!" He has also been cited as inspiration for video game designers including Shigeru Miyamoto on The Legend of Zelda and Hironobu Sakaguchi on Final Fantasy, as well as the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, and the video game Ori and the Blind Forest (2015).\nStudio Ghibli has searched for some time for Miyazaki and Suzuki\'s successor to lead the studio; Kond\u014d, the director of Whisper of the Heart, was initially considered, but died from a sudden heart attack in 1998. Some candidates were considered by 2023\u2014including Miyazaki\'s son Goro, who declined\u2014but the studio was not able to find a successor.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n\nThe Castle of Cagliostro (1979)\nNausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984)\nLaputa: Castle in the Sky (1986)\nMy Neighbor Totoro (1988)\nKiki\'s Delivery Service (1989)\nPorco Rosso (1992)\nPrincess Mononoke (1997)\nSpirited Away (2001)\nHowl\'s Moving Castle (2004)\nPonyo (2008)\nThe Wind Rises (2013)\nThe Boy and the Heron (2023)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\nMiyazaki won the \u014cfuji Nobur\u014d Award at the Mainichi Film Awards for The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), and My Neighbor Totoro (1988), and the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film for Kiki\'s Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), Princess Mononoke (1997), Spirited Away (2001), and Whale Hunt (2001). Spirited Away and The Boy and the Heron were awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Howl\'s Moving Castle (2004) and The Wind Rises (2013) received nominations. He was named a Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in November 2012, for outstanding cultural contributions. In 2024, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and Gold House honored him on its Most Impactful Asians A100 list. His other accolades include several Annie Awards, Japan Academy Film Prizes, Kinema Junpo Awards, and Tokyo Anime Awards.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nStudio Ghibli (in Japanese)\nHayao Miyazaki  at Anime News Network\'s encyclopedia\nHayao Miyazaki at IMDb\nHayao Miyazaki at Library of Congress, with 14 library catalogue records\n> Running step 015c82f1-c7ff-4de0-9930-ab2467424c1c.

Designed to facilitate advanced automated theorem proving\nat the IMO level, FIMO is currently tailored for the Lean formal language. It\ncomprises 149 formal problem statements, accompanied by both informal problem\ndescriptions and their corresponding LaTeX-based informal proofs. Through\ninitial experiments involving GPT-4, our findings underscore the existing\nlimitations in current methodologies, indicating a substantial journey ahead\nbefore achieving satisfactory IMO-level automated theorem proving outcomes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct_manager (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the paper titled "FIMO: A Challenge Formal Dataset for Automated Theorem Proving" and its summary, the potential applications of GPT-4 in software development can be related to the field of automated theorem proving.\n\n1. **Automated theorem proving**: GPT-4 can be utilized in the development of automated theorem proving software that attempts to prove complex mathematical problems taken from International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) or other challenging sources. By fine-tuning GPT-4 with a dataset like FIMO consisting of formal mathematical problems, the model can potentially better understand the problem statements and generate appropriate proofs.\n\n2. **Mathematical problem-solving assistants**: Software tools can be developed using GPT-4 to guide users in solving complex mathematical problems. The AI model can be integrated into educational platforms, online math tutoring services, or even standalone tools to help make solving problems easier and faster for students and professionals alike.\n\n3. **Formal language translation**: GPT-4 can potentially be integrated into software for translating between formal languages, assisting in the understanding and comparison of various formal systems. This would be especially useful in research communities employing different formal languages and wanting to share ideas and results.\n\n4. **Mathematical proof checking**: GPT-4 can be employed in proof-checking software to identify and correct inconsistencies. By improving the correctness of proofs, this application would ultimately help users save time and contribute to the overall quality of mathematical research.\n\nPlease note that this paper highlights the current limitations of GPT-4 in the context of IMO-level theorem proving. Nevertheless, these potential applications suggest directions for further research and software development as the model and related techniques continue to improve.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nUser_proxy (to chat_manager):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nUser_proxy (to chat_manager):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoder (to chat_manager):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},25551:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{assets:()=>c,contentTitle:()=>s,default:()=>h,frontMatter:()=>i,metadata:()=>r,toc:()=>l});var a=t(85893),o=t(11151);const i={custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",description:"Implement and manage a multi-agent chat system using AutoGen, where AI assistants retrieve information, generate code, and interact collaboratively to solve complex tasks, especially in areas not covered by their training data.",source_notebook:"/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",tags:["group chat","orchestration","RAG"],title:"Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation"},s="Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation",r={id:"notebooks/agentchat_groupchat_RAG",title:"Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation",description:"Implement and manage a multi-agent chat system using AutoGen, where AI assistants retrieve information, generate code, and interact collaboratively to solve complex tasks, especially in areas not covered by their training data.",source:"@site/docs/notebooks/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.mdx",sourceDirName:"notebooks",slug:"/notebooks/agentchat_groupchat_RAG",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_groupchat_RAG",draft:!1,unlisted:!1,editUrl:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",tags:[{label:"group chat",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/group-chat"},{label:"orchestration",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/orchestration"},{label:"RAG",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/rag"}],version:"current",frontMatter:{custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",description:"Implement and manage a multi-agent chat system using AutoGen, where AI assistants retrieve information, generate code, and interact collaboratively to solve complex tasks, especially in areas not covered by their training data.",source_notebook:"/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",tags:["group chat","orchestration","RAG"],title:"Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation"},sidebar:"notebooksSidebar",previous:{title:"Group Chat",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_groupchat"},next:{title:"Group Chat with Customized Speaker Selection Method",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_groupchat_customized"}},c={},l=[{value:"Set your API Endpoint",id:"set-your-api-endpoint",level:2},{value:"Construct Agents",id:"construct-agents",level:2},{value:"Start Chat",id:"start-chat",level:2},{value:"UserProxyAgent doesn\u2019t get the correct code",id:"userproxyagent-doesnt-get-the-correct-code",level:3},{value:"RetrieveUserProxyAgent get the correct code",id:"retrieveuserproxyagent-get-the-correct-code",level:3},{value:"Call RetrieveUserProxyAgent while init chat with another user proxy agent",id:"call-retrieveuserproxyagent-while-init-chat-with-another-user-proxy-agent",level:3}];function d(e){const n={a:"a",admonition:"admonition",code:"code",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",img:"img",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"group-chat-with-retrieval-augmented-generation",children:"Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg",alt:"Open In Colab"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_groupchat_RAG.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20GitHub-grey?logo=github",alt:"Open on GitHub"})})]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["AutoGen supports conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans,\nperforming tasks collectively via automated chat.

Give me sample code.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training.

However, there is one minor issue: if we are using the pandas-on-spark DataFrame `psdf`, the `fit` method should be called with `dataframe` and `label` arguments, not `X_train` and `y_train`.\n\nThis is because, with FLAML and Spark integration, the `fit` method expects the entire data as a single pandas-on-spark DataFrame along with the name of the target variable as `label`, rather than being provided with separate feature and target data as it would expect with standard pandas DataFrames.\n\nHere\'s the correct code snippet reflecting this:\n\n```python\nfrom flaml import AutoML\n\n# Assuming psdf is the pandas-on-spark dataframe and label is the name of the target variable\n# Presuming that the data conversion and feature vectorization have been done as shown in the context\n\nautoml = AutoML()\n\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 120,  # for example, set the time budget to 2 minutes\n    "metric": "accuracy",  # assuming a classification problem, change to "r2" for regression\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # specify the Spark estimator\n    "task": "classification",  # assuming a classification problem, change to "regression" for regression\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,  # number of concurrent Spark jobs\n    "use_spark": True,  # enable distributed training using Spark\n}\n\n# Use dataframe and label parameters to fit the model\nautoml.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label, **settings)\n```\n\nPlease ensure that your Spark cluster is correctly configured to support distributed training, and adjust the `metric`, `task`, and other settings as needed for your specific use case.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: Boss_Assistant\n\nBoss_Assistant (to chat_manager):\n\nReply `TERMINATE` if the task is done.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: Product_Manager\n\nProduct_Manager (to chat_manager):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"2024-08-14 06:59:09,583 - autogen.agentchat.contrib.retrieve_user_proxy_agent - INFO - Use the existing collection `groupchat`.\n2024-08-14 06:59:09,902 - autogen.agentchat.contrib.retrieve_user_proxy_agent - INFO - Found 2 chunks.\n2024-08-14 06:59:09,912 - autogen.agentchat.contrib.vectordb.chromadb - INFO - No content embedding is provided.

Give me sample code.\n\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n\n## Spark ML Estimators\n\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n\n### Data\n\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = "Price"\n\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\n\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\n\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]\n```\n\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n\n### Estimators\n\n#### Model List\n\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n\n#### Usage\n\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\n\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\'t specified them.\n\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\n\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional\n    "task": "regression",\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=psdf,\n    label=label,\n    **settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\n\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\n\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n\n```python\nimport flaml\n\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n    "time_budget": 30,\n    "metric": "r2",\n    "task": "regression",\n    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,\n    "use_spark": True,\n    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\n\nautoml.fit(\n    dataframe=dataframe,\n    label=label,\n    **automl_settings,\n)\n```\n\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Integrate - Spark\n\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training.

In\nthis work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate\npatient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data\non the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we\ndevelop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical\nexperts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show\nthat fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations\nfrom 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant\ninformation. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4\nwhen prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative\nevaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows\nvery good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\npromising results.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the abstract provided, the paper titled \"A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models\" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.\n\n**Potential Applications in Software:**\n\n1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**\n   - GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors' notes and other medical records.\n\n2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**\n   - Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient's medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\n3. **Patient Education and Communication:**\n   - Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.\n\n4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**\n   - GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.\n\n5. **Data Quality Assurance:**\n   - The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.\n\n6. **Research and Development:**\n   - GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.\n\n7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**\n   - Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.\n\nThese potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdmin (to chat_manager):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"ChatResult(chat_id=None, chat_history=[{'content': 'Find a latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Initial Plan:**\\n\\n1. **Scientist's Task: Literature Review**\\n   - The scientist will conduct a comprehensive literature review to find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv.

However, I can help you write a Python script that uses the arXiv API to fetch the data you need.\n\nHere's a Python script that uses the `arxiv` package to search for papers related to \"LLM applications\" from the last week. This script will print out the title, authors, summary, and URL of each paper.\n\n```python\nimport arxiv\nimport datetime\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = (datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')\n\n# Search for papers on LLM applications\nsearch = arxiv.Search(\n  query=\"LLM applications\",\n  max_results=100,\n  sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,\n  sort_order=arxiv.SortOrder.Descending\n)\n\nfor result in search.get():\n  # Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\n  if result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\n    print(f\"Title: {result.title}\")\n    print(f\"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)}\")\n    print(f\"Summary: {result.summary}\")\n    print(f\"URL: {result.entry_id}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n```\n\nYou can install the `arxiv` package using pip:\n\n```shell\npip install arxiv\n```\n\nPlease note that you'll need to replace `\"LLM applications\"` with the actual search term you're interested in. The arXiv API doesn't support searching by the submission date, so the script fetches the 100 most recent results and filters them manually. You may need to increase `max_results` if there are more than 100 papers submitted per week on your topic.\n\nTo create a markdown table, you'll need to format the output like this:\n\n```markdown\n| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|-------|---------|---------|-----|\n| ...   | ...     | ...     | ... |\n```\n\nYou can do this in Python using f-strings:\n\n```python\nprint(\"| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\")\nprint(\"|-------|---------|---------|-----|\")\nfor result in search.get():\n  # Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\n  if result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\n    print(f\"| {result.title} | {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)} | {result.summary} | {result.entry_id} |\")\n```\n\nThis will print a markdown table to the console.

Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of\nunderstanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.\nThis study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in\ndata preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.\nWe delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,\nand entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of\nLLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational\nexpense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data\npreprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,\ncoupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,\nto improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of\nLLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning\n12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\\% accuracy or F1 score\non 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite\ncertain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain\nand anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1 |\n| Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls | Jesutofunmi A. Omiye, Haiwen Gui, Shawheen J. Rezaei, James Zou, Roxana Daneshjou | Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to tasks in healthcare,\nranging from medical exam questions to responding to patient questions. With\nincreasing institutional partnerships between companies producing LLMs and\nhealthcare systems, real world clinical application is coming closer to\nreality. As these models gain traction, it is essential for healthcare\npractitioners to understand what LLMs are, their development, their current and\npotential applications, and the associated pitfalls when utilized in medicine.\nThis review and accompanying tutorial aim to give an overview of these topics\nto aid healthcare practitioners in understanding the rapidly changing landscape\nof LLMs as applied to medicine. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1 |\n| Point-Bind & Point-LLM: Aligning Point Cloud with Multi-modality for 3D Understanding, Generation, and Instruction Following | Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Xiangyang Zhu, Yiwen Tang, Xianzheng Ma, Jiaming Han, Kexin Chen, Peng Gao, Xianzhi Li, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng | We introduce Point-Bind, a 3D multi-modality model aligning point clouds with\n2D image, language, audio, and video. Guided by ImageBind, we construct a joint\nembedding space between 3D and multi-modalities, enabling many promising\napplications, e.g., any-to-3D generation, 3D embedding arithmetic, and 3D\nopen-world understanding. On top of this, we further present Point-LLM, the\nfirst 3D large language model (LLM) following 3D multi-modal instructions. By\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, Point-LLM injects the semantics of\nPoint-Bind into pre-trained LLMs, e.g., LLaMA, which requires no 3D instruction\ndata, but exhibits superior 3D and multi-modal question-answering capacity. We\nhope our work may cast a light on the community for extending 3D point clouds\nto multi-modality applications.

Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs\nfor human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob,\nwhich leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nfor analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and\ncontext stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human\nmovement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the\nprediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that\nenable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations of\nour method reveal that LLM-Mob excels in providing accurate and interpretable\npredictions, highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs in advancing human\nmobility prediction techniques. We posit that our research marks a significant\nparadigm shift in human mobility modelling, transitioning from building complex\ndomain-specific models to harnessing general-purpose LLMs that yield accurate\npredictions through language instructions.

The instructions given to the LLM by natural\nlanguage may include ambiguity and lack of information depending on the task\ncontext. It is possible to adjust the output of LLM by making the instruction\ninput more detailed; however, the design cost is high. In this paper, we\npropose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to\nanalyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The\nmethod can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions.\nWe demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in\ncooking tasks. However, our experiments also revealed challenges in robot\naction planning with LLM, such as asking unimportant questions and assuming\ncrucial information without asking. Shedding light on these issues provides\nvaluable insights for future research on utilizing LLM for robotics. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15684v1 |\n| AskIt: Unified Programming Interface for Programming with Large Language Models | Katsumi Okuda, Saman Amarasinghe | In the evolving landscape of software development, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) exhibit a unique phenomenon known as emergent abilities, demonstrating\nadeptness across numerous tasks, from text summarization to code generation.\nWhile these abilities open up novel avenues in software design and crafting,\ntheir incorporation presents substantial challenges. Developers grapple with\ndecisions surrounding the direct embedding of LLMs within applications versus\nemploying them for code generation. Moreover, effective prompt design becomes a\ncritical concern, given the necessity of data extraction from natural language\noutputs. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces AskIt, a\ndomain-specific language (DSL) specifically designed for LLMs. AskIt simplifies\nLLM integration, offering type-guided output control, template-based function\ndefinitions, and a unified interface that diminishes the distinction between\nLLM-based code generation and application integration. Furthermore, through\nProgramming by Example (PBE), AskIt harnesses the power of few-shot learning at\nthe programming language level. Our evaluations underscore AskIt's potency.\nAcross 50 tasks, AskIt generated concise prompts for the given tasks, achieving\na 16.14% reduction in prompt length relative to benchmarks. Additionally, by\nenabling the transition from direct LLM application usage to function\ngeneration, AskIt achieved significant speedups, as observed in our GSM8K\nbenchmark experiments. Through these advancements, AskIt streamlines the\nintegration of LLMs in software development, offering a more efficient,\nversatile approach for leveraging emergent abilities. The implementations of\nAskIt in TypeScript and Python are available at\nhttps://github.com/katsumiok/ts-askit and https://github.com/katsumiok/pyaskit,\nrespectively. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15645v1 |\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist (to chat_manager):\n\nHere are the papers related to LLM applications published in the last week:\n\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|-------|---------|---------|-----|-----|\n| Data Preprocessing | [Large Language Models as Data Preprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) | Haochen Zhang, Yuyang Dong, Chuan Xiao, Masafumi Oyamada | This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) |\n| Medicine | [Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1) | Jesutofunmi A.

This investigation presents an innovative framework that\nstrategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the\nsynergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and\naugmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed\nSoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from\nsummarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a\nconcise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This\ndepiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing\ninformation retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that\nour framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs\'\nefficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the\ncaliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with\nsophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of\nmanaging lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point\ntowards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs\' applicability and\nefficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world\napplications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing\nlanguage models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and\nsummarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation\nof NLP solutions.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997v1\n\n---\n\nTitle: Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models\nAuthors: Xusen Guo, Qiming Zhang, Mingxing Peng, Meixin Zhu, Hao, Yang\nAbstract: Traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban planning, transportation\nmanagement, and infrastructure development. However, achieving both accuracy\nand interpretability in prediction models remains challenging due to the\ncomplexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning\nmethodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Traffic Flow\nPrediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ngenerate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modal\ntraffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complex\nspatial-temporal patterns and external factors such as weather conditions,\nPoints of Interest (PoIs), date, and holidays. We fine-tune the LLM framework\nusing language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow\ndata. Our comprehensive multi-modal traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) in\nCalifornia enables the evaluation of TF-LLM against state-of-the-art deep\nlearning baselines. Results demonstrate TF-LLM\'s competitive accuracy while\nproviding intuitive and interpretable predictions. We discuss the\nspatial-temporal and input dependencies for explainable future flow\nforecasting, showcasing TF-LLM\'s potential for diverse city prediction tasks.\nThis paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and\nlays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from\n  LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning\nAuthors: Siyu Zha, Yuehan Qiao, Qingyu Hu, Zhongsheng Li, Jiangtao Gong, Yingqing Xu\nAbstract: Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that is very helpful\nin nurturing students\' creativity, but it requires significant time and energy\nfrom both students and teachers. Large language models (LLMs) have been proven\nto assist in creative tasks, yet much controversy exists regarding their role\nin fostering creativity. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL\nsettings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an\nexploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five\ndesign considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we\ndeveloped an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional\nexperiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can\nenhance every stage of PBL. Additionally, we also discovered ambivalent\nperspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we\nexplored the challenge and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and\nreflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational\npractice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into\nharnessing AI\'s potential in child-centric educational settings.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16159v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health\nAuthors: Hannah R. Lawrence, Renee A. Schneider, Susan B. Rubin, Maja J. Mataric, Daniel J. McDuff, Megan Jones Bell\nAbstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing\nrealization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately\nexpand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nhas come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale\nsolutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already\nbeen applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the\nextant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,\nassessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive\nimpact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application\nto mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks.\nThe urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible\ndevelopment, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical\nis ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance\nmental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including\nthose with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all\nstages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will\nminimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs\nwill positively impact mental health globally.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature\n  Review\nAuthors: Zheyuan He, Zihao Li, Sen Yang\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various\ndomains involving blockchain security (BS). Several recent studies are\nexploring LLMs applied to BS. However, there remains a gap in our understanding\nregarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of\nLLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we conduct a literature review\non LLM4BS.\n  As the first review of LLM\'s application on blockchain security, our study\naims to comprehensively analyze existing research and elucidate how LLMs\ncontribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough\nexamination of scholarly works, we delve into the integration of LLMs into\nvarious aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which\nLLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart\ncontract auditing, identity verification, anomaly detection, vulnerable repair,\nand so on. Furthermore, we critically assess the challenges and limitations\nassociated with leveraging LLMs for blockchain security, considering factors\nsuch as scalability, privacy concerns, and adversarial attacks. Our review\nsheds light on the opportunities and potential risks inherent in this\nconvergence, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and\npolicymakers alike.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: Do Large Language Model Understand Multi-Intent Spoken Language ?\nAuthors: Shangjian Yin, Peijie Huang, Yuhong Xu, Haojing Huang, Jiatian Chen\nAbstract: This study marks a significant advancement by harnessing Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU), proposing a\nunique methodology that capitalizes on the generative power of LLMs within an\nSLU context. Our innovative technique reconfigures entity slots specifically\nfor LLM application in multi-intent SLU environments and introduces the concept\nof Sub-Intent Instruction (SII), enhancing the dissection and interpretation of\nintricate, multi-intent communication within varied domains. The resultant\ndatasets, dubbed LM-MixATIS and LM-MixSNIPS, are crafted from pre-existing\nbenchmarks. Our research illustrates that LLMs can match and potentially excel\nbeyond the capabilities of current state-of-the-art multi-intent SLU models. It\nfurther explores LLM efficacy across various intent configurations and dataset\nproportions. Moreover, we introduce two pioneering metrics, Entity Slot\nAccuracy (ESA) and Combined Semantic Accuracy (CSA), to provide an in-depth\nanalysis of LLM proficiency in this complex field.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04481v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: Breaking the Language Barrier: Can Direct Inference Outperform\n  Pre-Translation in Multilingual LLM Applications?\nAuthors: Yotam Intrator, Matan Halfon, Roman Goldenberg, Reut Tsarfaty, Matan Eyal, Ehud Rivlin, Yossi Matias, Natalia Aizenberg\nAbstract: Large language models hold significant promise in multilingual applications.\nHowever, inherent biases stemming from predominantly English-centric\npre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e.,\ntranslating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to\ncomplexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for\npre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have\nbeen established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a\ncomprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse benchmarks,\nincluding open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar\nstudies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in\nprior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2.\nSpecifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108\nlanguages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective\nmultilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with\npre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04792v1\n\n---\n\nTitle: SciAssess: Benchmarking LLM Proficiency in Scientific Literature\n  Analysis\nAuthors: Hengxing Cai, Xiaochen Cai, Junhan Chang, Sihang Li, Lin Yao, Changxin Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Hongshuai Wang, Yongge Li, Mujie Lin, Shuwen Yang, Jiankun Wang, Yuqi Yin, Yaqi Li, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke\nAbstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\nnatural language understanding and generation, igniting a surge of interest in\nleveraging these technologies in the field of scientific literature analysis.\nExisting benchmarks, however, inadequately evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in\nscientific literature analysis, especially in scenarios involving complex\ncomprehension and multimodal data. In response, we introduced SciAssess, a\nbenchmark tailored for the in-depth analysis of scientific literature, crafted\nto provide a thorough assessment of LLMs\' efficacy. SciAssess focuses on\nevaluating LLMs\' abilities in memorization, comprehension, and analysis within\nthe context of scientific literature analysis. It includes representative tasks\nfrom diverse scientific fields, such as general chemistry, organic materials,\nand alloy materials. And rigorous quality control measures ensure its\nreliability in terms of correctness, anonymization, and copyright compliance.\nSciAssess evaluates leading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini,\nidentifying their strengths and aspects for improvement and supporting the\nongoing development of LLM applications in scientific literature analysis.\nSciAssess and its resources are made available at https://sci-assess.github.io,\noffering a valuable tool for advancing LLM capabilities in scientific\nliterature analysis.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01976v2\n\n---\n\nTitle: Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text\nAuthors: Chulin Xie, Zinan Lin, Arturs Backurs, Sivakanth Gopi, Da Yu, Huseyin A Inan, Harsha Nori, Haotian Jiang, Huishuai Zhang, Yin Tat Lee, Bo Li, Sergey Yekhanin\nAbstract: Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine\nlearning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data\ngenerated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used\nfreely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text\ndata with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a\npromising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP\nfinetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP\nsynthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g.,\nGPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source\nLLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE)\nalgorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion\nmodels. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that\napplies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and\ngenerate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE\nproduces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP\nfinetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API\naccess of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating\nmore accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications. Our code and\ndata are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01749v1\n\n---\n\nTitle: SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards\n  Oracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction\nAuthors: Jiahuan Yan, Jintai Chen, Chaowen Hu, Bo Zheng, Yaojun Hu, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu\nAbstract: Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive\nzero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs\'\napplication on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily\ndue to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge.\nFurthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires\nlabor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge\nin enhancing the model\'s vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose\nSERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of\nvertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement.\nSpecifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM\'s zero-shot outputs as annotations,\nleveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch.\nReversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its\nzero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative\nprocess. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly\nannotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold\nlabels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model\nattains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical\ndatasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic\nscenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the\npotential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training\nvertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570v2\n\n---\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearch_Action_1 (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the provided code output, here is a markdown table categorizing the papers by domain, along with their titles, authors, summaries, and links:\n\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | Link |\n|--------|-------|---------|---------|------|\n| Natural Language Processing | Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression | Cangqing Wang, et al. | The paper presents a framework for efficient context processing in LLMs using natural language summarization and soft prompt compression. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997v1) |\n| Transportation | Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models | Xusen Guo, et al. | This paper introduces a novel approach for interpretable traffic flow predictions using LLMs, which captures complex spatial-temporal patterns. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v2) |\n| Education | Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning | Siyu Zha, et al. | The study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing project-based learning (PBL) and fostering creativity in educational settings. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16159v2) |\n| Mental Health | The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health | Hannah R.

Then, we'll adjust the column names in the scatter plot as needed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser_proxy (to chat_manager):\n\nexitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 15, in <module>\n    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Weight_in_lbs', y='Horsepower')\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py\", line 742, in scatterplot\n    p = _ScatterPlotter(data=data, variables=variables, legend=legend)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py\", line 538, in __init__\n    super().__init__(data=data, variables=variables)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 640, in __init__\n    self.assign_variables(data, variables)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 701, in assign_variables\n    plot_data, variables = self._assign_variables_longform(\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 938, in _assign_variables_longform\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Could not interpret value `Weight_in_lbs` for parameter `x`\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser_proxy (to chat_manager):\n\nexitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 15, in <module>\n    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Weight_in_lbs', y='Horsepower')\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py\", line 742, in scatterplot\n    p = _ScatterPlotter(data=data, variables=variables, legend=legend)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py\", line 538, in __init__\n    super().__init__(data=data, variables=variables)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 640, in __init__\n    self.assign_variables(data, variables)\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 701, in assign_variables\n    plot_data, variables = self._assign_variables_longform(\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py\", line 938, in _assign_variables_longform\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Could not interpret value `Weight_in_lbs` for parameter `x`\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoder (to chat_manager):\n\nI apologize for the confusion.

Date Axis: The dates on the x-axis are not visible or readable, which makes it hard to associate the temperature data with specific time periods. Consider formatting the date axis so that the dates are displayed at a readable angle or with sufficient spacing.\n\n2. X-axis Labeling: There appears to be an issue with the x-axis labels or ticks as it shows a dense black area, indicating overlapping or condensed labels. The frequency and format of the labels should be adjusted to prevent overlap and allow for clear reading.\n\n3. Y-axis Range: Consider starting the y-axis at a lower value if the temperature data permits, to give more space to the temperature lines and improve readability.\n\n4. Gridlines: Adding horizontal gridlines can aid in reading specific temperatures at a glance.\n\n5. Legend: The legend clearly indicates which color corresponds to high and low temperatures, which is good. Ensure the legend does not obscure any important data.\n\n6. Resolution: The actual resolution of the image may be fine, but the x-axis issue might give the illusion of a low-resolution image. Once the x-axis is corrected, the overall clarity of the chart may naturally improve.\n\n7. Color Contrast: The blue and orange color choices are generally good for contrast, but ensure they are differentiable to all users, including those who may be colorblind. Consider using colorblind-friendly palettes.\n\n8.

This process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Install the `yfinance` package (if not already installed).\n2. Use `yfinance` to fetch the current stock prices of NVDA and TSLA.\n3. Fetch historical data for the past month for both stocks.\n4. Calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the last month based on the historical data.\n\nPlease execute the following Python code to perform these tasks:\n\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef stock_performance(ticker):\n    # Fetching data for the past month\n    end_date = datetime.today()\n    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)  # Approximate for the past month\n    \n    # Fetch historical data\n    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n    \n    # Current and beginning of month prices\n    current_price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]\n    start_month_price = data['Close'].iloc[0] \n    \n    # Calculate percentage change over the month\n    percent_change = ((current_price - start_month_price) / start_month_price) * 100\n    \n    return current_price, percent_change\n\n# NVDA and TSLA stock performance\nnvda_price, nvda_change = stock_performance(\"NVDA\")\ntsla_price, tsla_change = stock_performance(\"TSLA\")\n\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corp) current price: ${nvda_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) current price: ${tsla_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {tsla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nBefore running this script, ensure that you have the `yfinance` package installed. If not, install it using the following command:\n\n```sh\npip install yfinance\n```\n\nThis script will output the current stock prices of NVDA and TSLA, along with their performance over the past month in percentage terms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 1 (inferred language is sh)...\nUser (to Financial_assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nNVDA (NVIDIA Corp) current price: $878.37, Performance over past month: 20.97%\nTSLA (Tesla, Inc.) current price: $163.57, Performance over past month: -18.19%\n\nDefaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable\nRequirement already satisfied: yfinance in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (0.2.37)\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas>=1.3.0 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.2.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.16.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests>=2.31 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.31.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: multitasking>=0.0.7 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (0.0.11)\nRequirement already satisfied: lxml>=4.9.1 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (5.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: appdirs>=1.4.4 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2022.5 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2024.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: frozendict>=2.3.4 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: peewee>=3.16.2 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (3.17.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (4.12.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: html5lib>=1.1 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1->yfinance) (2.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.9 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (1.16.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: webencodings in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (0.5.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas>=1.3.0->yfinance) (2.9.0.post0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tzdata>=2022.7 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas>=1.3.0->yfinance) (2024.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.3.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (2.2.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (2024.2.2)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nThe code execution was successful, and here are the results based on the output:\n\n- **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)** has a current stock price of **$878.37**.

Then, we can plot these calculated prices on a graph to visually compare the trends. \n\nLet's proceed as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the stock price 30 days ago for both companies based on the current price and the given percentage change.\n2. Generate a list of stock prices from 30 days ago to the current date for both companies, assuming a linear trend for simplicity. \n3. Plot these lists against the dates of the past month.\n\nI'll start by calculating the stock price 30 days ago for both companies and generating the lists of stock prices. \n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\ncurrent_price_nvda = 878.37\nchange_percent_nvda = 20.97\ncurrent_price_tsla = 163.57\nchange_percent_tsla = -18.19\n\n# Calculate the price 30 days ago based on the current price and percentage change\nprice_30_days_ago_nvda = current_price_nvda / (1 + change_percent_nvda / 100)\nprice_30_days_ago_tsla = current_price_tsla / (1 + change_percent_tsla / 100)\n\n# Generate the dates and stock prices for the past 30 days\ndates = np.arange(-29, 1, 1)  # Day -29 to 0, representing the past 30 days\nprices_nvda = np.linspace(price_30_days_ago_nvda, current_price_nvda, 30)\nprices_tsla = np.linspace(price_30_days_ago_tsla, current_price_tsla, 30)\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(dates, prices_nvda, label=\"NVIDIA (NVDA)\")\nplt.plot(dates, prices_tsla, label=\"Tesla (TSLA)\")\n\nplt.title(\"Stock Price Comparison Over the Past Month\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Days Ago\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Price ($)\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code snippet calculates the stock prices for NVDA and TSLA 30 days ago using the provided current prices and percentage changes. It then generates a linear progression of prices over the last month and plots the comparison.

(TSLA), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Market Trends and News:** Look for any recent news or market trends related to NVIDIA and Tesla. This could include product launches, earnings reports, significant partnerships, or changes in the global market that might influence these companies differently.\n2. **Industry Impact:** Assess how changes in the technology and automotive industries might have differently affected NVIDIA and Tesla. For NVIDIA, advancements or demands in gaming, data centers, and AI could play a role, while for Tesla, factors could include electric vehicle (EV) market dynamics, production issues, or regulatory changes.\n3. **Financial Performance:** Analyze recent financial performance reports from both companies to see if there are any indicators of why their stock prices have moved in such opposite directions.\n4. **Investor Sentiment:** Investigate the overall investor sentiment towards these companies. This could involve looking at analyst ratings, investor forums, or news commentary.\n5. **External Factors:** Consider any external factors that might have had an impact, like changes in trade policies, geopolitical tensions, or significant shifts in consumer behavior due to global events.\n\nAs we would need real-time data and specific detailed analyses which are best done through current financial news articles, market analyses, and company reports to proceed accurately, I can provide an example code snippet to fetch recent news regarding NVIDIA and Tesla from the web using Python. This might help identify some potential reasons for their stock performance based on recent events.\n\n```python\n# filename: fetch_news.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef fetch_news(stock_name):\n    search_query = stock_name + ' stock news'\n    url = f\"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_query.replace(' ', '+')}&tbm=nws\"\n    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'}\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n    for item in soup.find_all('div', attrs={'class': 'dbsr'}):\n        title = item.find('div', attrs={'class': 'JheGif nDgy9d'}).text\n        source_and_time = item.find('div', attrs={'class': 'SVJrMe'}).text\n        link = item.a['href']\n        print(f'Title: {title}\\nSource and Time: {source_and_time}\\nLink: {link}\\n')\n\n# Fetch news for NVIDIA\nprint('NVIDIA News:')\nfetch_news('NVIDIA')\n\n# Fetch news for Tesla\nprint('\\nTesla News:')\nfetch_news('Tesla')\n```\n\nPlease run the above Python script. It will scrape Google News for recent articles related to NVIDIA and Tesla, which might provide insights into the reasons behind their recent stock performances. Note, however, that web scraping Google might violate their terms of service and the effectiveness of the script could vary over time due to changes in the Google News page structure. This script is provided for educational purposes to demonstrate a technique for gathering information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser (to Researcher):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nNVIDIA News:\n\nTesla News:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nThe execution of the code was successful, and it generated a plot comparing the stock prices of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) over the past month. The plot should visually depict NVIDIA's stock price increase and Tesla's decrease during this period, based on the linear assumptions we made for simplicity.\n\nSince the plot has been generated as expected, you should now have a visual representation showing how NVDA's stock price trended upwards over the past month, while TSLA's stock price trended downwards. This comparison could provide insights into the overall performance and market sentiment towards these two companies during the last month.\n\nIf you have any more requests or need further analysis, feel free to ask!\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearcher (to User):\n\nIt appears that the provided script didn't fetch the news as expected. This limitation might be due to changes in the website structure, anti-scraping measures, or the fact that extracting information from Google's search results can be particularly challenging due to their dynamic nature and terms of service.\n\nGiven this, I recommend using alternative methods to investigate the reasons behind NVIDIA's and Tesla's recent stock performance. These can include:\n\n1. **Checking Financial News Websites:** Websites like Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters often provide up-to-date news and analysis on companies and their stock performances. \n2. **Official Company Press Releases:** Both NVIDIA's and Tesla's official websites have press release sections, where they publish news that could significantly impact their stock prices, such as earnings reports, product launches, or strategic partnerships.\n3. **Financial Analysis Platforms:** Platforms like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Seeking Alpha offer news, financial data, and analyses which can provide insights into recent stock performance.\n4. **Social Media and Forums:** Financial communities on platforms like Twitter, Reddit (especially the r/investing subreddit), and StockTwits can sometimes provide real-time insights and sentiments that might be influencing stock prices.\n\nWithout specific recent news or data obtained directly from such sources, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for NVIDIA's and Tesla's recent stock performance. However, based on the context provided:\n\n- **NVIDIA's Increase:** The increase in NVIDIA's stock price could be linked to heightened demand for its GPUs amid trends such as gaming, data center expansion, and AI development. NVIDIA is deeply involved in these rapidly growing sectors, and any positive news or indicators related to them could significantly impact its stock.\n  \n- **Tesla's Decrease:** Tesla's decline might be influenced by a variety of factors, from production challenges, competition in the electric vehicle industry increasing, potential regulatory challenges, or even Elon Musk's public statements affecting investor sentiment. Tesla's performance is also highly scrutinized, so broader market trends or operational hiccups can have a pronounced effect on its stock price.\n\nTo get the most accurate picture, I recommend visiting the suggested financial news websites and platforms directly to gather the latest insights and analyses on NVIDIA and Tesla. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their stock performance drivers.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n********************************************************************************\nStarting a new chat....\n\nMessage:\nDevelop an engaging blog post using any information provided.\n\nCarryover: \nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) experienced a stock price increase of 20.97% over the past month, with a current price of $878.37.

(TSLA) stand out, painting two very different pictures. Over the past month, NVIDIA witnessed an awe-inspiring surge of 20.97% in its stock price, reaching a towering $878.37. Meanwhile, Tesla faced a starkly contrasting fate, with its stock price tumbling down 18.19% to $163.57. But what underlying currents steered these two tech giants in such divergent directions? Let's delve deeper into the whirlpool of market dynamics, technological advancements, and investor sentiment to uncover the story behind these movements.\n\n#### NVIDIA's Stellar Ascent\n\nNVIDIA, a titan in the realms of graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI), and data centers, has been on a meteoric rise. The company's stock surge can largely be attributed to the burgeoning demand for GPUs, indispensable not only in gaming but also in a plethora of applications from advanced computing tasks to mining cryptocurrencies. This demand spike has catapulted NVIDIA into a favorable position in the stock market.\n\nMoreover, NVIDIA's forays into AI development and data centers have underpinned its financial fortitude. As businesses and institutions increasingly leverage AI for efficiency and innovation, NVIDIA's cutting-edge technologies stand at the forefront, driving its stock prices to new heights.\n\n#### Tesla's Turbulent Tide\n\nTesla, Inc., on the other hand, has navigated through rough waters. Known for revolutionizing the electric vehicle (EV) industry, Tesla has recently grappled with a gamut of challenges. Production snags, possibly accentuated by global supply chain disruptions, have hindered Tesla's ability to meet its ambitious production targets. Furthermore, the EV sphere is no longer Tesla's sole dominion; rising competition has emerged as a formidable force, with legacy automakers and new entrants alike vying for a piece of the EV pie.\n\nRegulatory woes and occasional controversial public statements by its charismatic yet polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, have also played a role in swaying investor sentiment, contributing to the stock's decline. These factors combined sketch the backdrop against which Tesla's stock has weathered a downturn.\n\n#### The Tale of Two Graphs\n\nVisualizing the stock performance of NVIDIA and Tesla over the last month through a simple linear graph vividly elucidates their trajectories \u2014 NVIDIA's stock price ascends skyward, while Tesla's takes a steep downturn. This visual comparison starkly captures the fortunes and misfortunes unfolding in the high-stakes world of the stock market.\n\n#### Looking Beyond the Horizon\n\nThe stock market is a reflection of myriad factors \u2014 technological innovation, market demand, competitive landscape, and investor perception. NVIDIA's ascendancy underscores the growing clout of AI and data centers, heralding an era where these technologies shape market dynamics. Tesla's struggles, meanwhile, highlight the hurdles of scaling production amidst stiffening competition and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAs investors and market aficionados peer into the crystal ball, seeking to divine the future paths of NVIDIA and Tesla, they are reminded of the market's inherent unpredictability. What's certain, though, is that the stories of NVIDIA and Tesla \u2014 each fascinating in its own right \u2014 will continue to captivate and instruct, offering valuable lessons in resilience, innovation, and the ever-persistent pursuit of progress.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe contrasting destinies of NVIDIA and Tesla in the stock market serve as a compelling narrative of triumph and tribulation. While NVIDIA rides the wave of technological advancement to new heights, Tesla navigates a challenging course, underlining the complexities of sustaining growth amidst evolving market dynamics. As their stories continue to unfold, both NVIDIA and Tesla offer invaluable insights into the intricate dance of innovation, investment, and influence in shaping the future of technology and industry.\n\n---\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"/workspaces/autogen/autogen/agentchat/chat.py:42: UserWarning: Repetitive recipients detected: The chat history will be cleared by default if a recipient appears more than once.

Fetch historical data for the past month for both stocks.\n4. Calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the last month based on the historical data.\n\nPlease execute the following Python code to perform these tasks:\n\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef stock_performance(ticker):\n    # Fetching data for the past month\n    end_date = datetime.today()\n    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)  # Approximate for the past month\n    \n    # Fetch historical data\n    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n    \n    # Current and beginning of month prices\n    current_price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]\n    start_month_price = data['Close'].iloc[0] \n    \n    # Calculate percentage change over the month\n    percent_change = ((current_price - start_month_price) / start_month_price) * 100\n    \n    return current_price, percent_change\n\n# NVDA and TSLA stock performance\nnvda_price, nvda_change = stock_performance(\"NVDA\")\ntsla_price, tsla_change = stock_performance(\"TSLA\")\n\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corp) current price: ${nvda_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) current price: ${tsla_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {tsla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nBefore running this script, ensure that you have the `yfinance` package installed. If not, install it using the following command:\n\n```sh\npip install yfinance\n```\n\nThis script will output the current stock prices of NVDA and TSLA, along with their performance over the past month in percentage terms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser (to Financial_assistant):\n\nPls add Microsoft as well\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nTo include Microsoft (MSFT) in the analysis alongside NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and TSLA (Tesla, Inc.), we can modify the provided Python script to fetch and calculate the performance for MSFT as well. The revised script will now include Microsoft's current stock price and its performance over the past month in terms of percentage change. Please execute the updated Python code below:\n\n```python\n# filename: stock_info_updated.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef stock_performance(ticker):\n    # Fetching data for the past month\n    end_date = datetime.today()\n    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)  # Approximate for the past month\n    \n    # Fetch historical data\n    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n    \n    # Current and beginning of month prices\n    current_price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]\n    start_month_price = data['Close'].iloc[0] \n    \n    # Calculate percentage change over the month\n    percent_change = ((current_price - start_month_price) / start_month_price) * 100\n    \n    return current_price, percent_change\n\n# Tickers for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT\nstocks = {\"NVDA\": \"NVIDIA Corp\", \"TSLA\": \"Tesla, Inc.\", \"MSFT\": \"Microsoft Corp\"}\n\n# Iterate through each stock and print information\nfor ticker, name in stocks.items():\n    price, change = stock_performance(ticker)\n    print(f\"{name} (Ticker: {ticker}) current price: ${price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {change:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThis script now includes Microsoft (ticker symbol: MSFT) in the analysis, providing its current stock price and the percentage change over the past month along with NVDA and TSLA. \n\nBefore running this script, make sure you have installed the `yfinance` package. Use the `pip install yfinance` command if the package is not already installed. This will ensure that the code can execute successfully and retrieve the stock information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser (to Financial_assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nNVIDIA Corp (Ticker: NVDA) current price: $878.37, Performance over past month: 20.97%\nTesla, Inc.

(TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT), first, we'll calculate their prices a month ago based on the current prices and the percentage change. Then, we will plot the current and past month's prices on a graph for a visual comparison.\n\n### Calculating the Prices a Month Ago\nTo calculate the price a month ago, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price a Month Ago} = \\frac{\\text{Current Price}}{1 + \\text{Percentage Change}}\n\\]\n\nFor a decrease in price, the percentage change will be considered negative in the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the stock prices a month ago and proceed to plot the graph in Python:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Current stock prices\ncurrent_prices = {\"NVDA\": 878.37, \"TSLA\": 163.57, \"MSFT\": 416.42}\n\n# Percentage changes (positive for increase, negative for decrease)\npercentage_changes = {\"NVDA\": 20.97, \"TSLA\": -18.19, \"MSFT\": 3.06}\n\n# Calculating prices a month ago\nprices_a_month_ago = {stock: current_prices[stock] / (1 + percentage_changes[stock] / 100) for stock in current_prices}\n\n# Data for plotting\nstocks = list(current_prices.keys())\ncurrent_prices_values = list(current_prices.values())\nprices_a_month_ago_values = list(prices_a_month_ago.values())\n\n# Plotting\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nindex = range(len(stocks))\nbar_width = 0.35\n\nbars1 = ax.bar(index, prices_a_month_ago_values, bar_width, label='Month Ago')\nbars2 = ax.bar([p + bar_width for p in index], current_prices_values, bar_width, label='Current')\n\nax.set_xlabel('Stock')\nax.set_ylabel('Price ($)')\nax.set_title('Stock Prices Comparison Over the Past Month')\nax.set_xticks([p + bar_width / 2 for p in index])\nax.set_xticklabels(stocks)\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code calculates the stock prices from a month ago based on the given current prices and percentage changes. Then, it plots a grouped bar chart comparing the prices. Execute this Python code to visualize the comparison of stock prices over the past month for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser (to Financial_assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nFigure(640x480)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nFinancial_assistant (to User):\n\nThe output indicates that the code executed successfully and generated a plot. Since the visualization itself cannot be displayed directly in this text exchange, it's implied that the figure showed a comparison of the stock prices over the past month for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\n\nFrom the given data and the intention behind the code:\n\n- NVIDIA (NVDA) would have shown a significant rise from its price a month ago to the current price, illustrating its 20.97% growth.\n- Tesla (TSLA) would have shown a decrease in its stock price, reflecting the 18.19% decline over the past month.\n- Microsoft (MSFT) would have indicated a moderate increase from its price a month ago to its current price, showcasing its 3.06% growth.\n\nThis comparison provides insight into each company's stock performance over the last month, highlighting NVDA's significant growth, MSFT's moderate growth, and TSLA's decline. These insights can be valuable for investors, market analysts, and enthusiasts trying to understand market trends or make informed decisions.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance with a different query, feel free to ask. Otherwise, that concludes our task.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n********************************************************************************\nStarting a new chat....\n\nMessage:\nDevelop an engaging blog post using any information provided.\n\nCarryover: \nThe current stock prices and the percentage changes over the past month for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Tesla, Inc.

(TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). Over the past month, these tech giants have each narrated a story of market valiance, caution, and resilience. Here, we delve into these narratives, unwrapping the numbers to discover what fuels their journeys.\n\n#### A Soaring Giant: NVIDIA's Unmatched Flight\n\nStarting on a high note, NVDA has outpaced expectations, marking a hefty 20.97% increase in its stock price, landing at a stunning $878.37. This surge is not just a number\u2014it's a testament to NVIDIA's stronghold on the GPU market, driven by an insatiable demand in gaming, professional markets, and groundbreaking advancements in AI technologies. As we look behind the curtain, we find a company not merely riding the tech wave but creating it, suggesting that NVIDIA's ascent is built on solid ground.\n\n#### A Turbulent Ride: The Tesla Saga\n\nOn the flip side of this high-flying story is Tesla, Inc. The electric vehicle behemoth saw its stock price retract by 18.19%, a notable dip to $163.57. At first glance, this might raise alarm bells, hinting at a potential stall in Tesla's meteoric rise. However, those familiar with Tesla's trajectory know this is but a chapter in its rollercoaster narrative. Factors such as production and delivery figures, regulatory landscapes, and the mercurial nature of Elon Musk's public announcements often sway Tesla's stock. Behind the scenes, Tesla's ambition and innovation engine runs full throttle, suggesting this downturn could be a mere blip in its revolutionary path.\n\n#### Steady as She Goes: Microsoft's Calculated Climb\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corp charts a more moderate course. With a 3.06% increase, its stock price reached $416.42. This growth, while not as eye-catching as NVIDIA's, is reflective of Microsoft's strategic positioning in cloud computing, productivity software, and potentially lucrative contracts or partnerships. Unlike the dramatic swings of NVDA and TSLA, MSFT's journey is one of calculated progression, relying on consistent performance and innovation within its stronghold arenas.\n\n#### The Bigger Picture\n\nWhat these stories reveal is a complex tapestry of market dynamics. NVIDIA's leap underscores the immense potential and growing demand in cutting-edge technologies. Tesla's situation is a reminder of the volatility inherent to ambitious, disruptive companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft's steady ascent illustrates the power of sustained growth in core areas. For investors and enthusiasts alike, these developments highlight the importance of context and perspective when navigating the stock market seas.\n\nUnderstanding the \u2018why\u2019 behind stock performance is crucial. While this snapshot offers a glimpse into a month's journey, diving into financial news websites and company investor relations pages can provide deeper insights into these fluctuations.\n\nAs we close this chapter, the saga of NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT continues. Each, in its own way, is a beacon of technological progress and market dynamics. For those watching from the sidelines, these stories are more than financial metrics; they are narratives of human ambition, innovation, and resilience\u2014a reminder that in the world of tech, the only constant is change.\n\n*To those seeking to chart their course in the stock market waters, let these narratives be your guide, your caution, and your inspiration.*\n\n*Happy Investing!*\n\n---\n\nI'm always here to craft more compelling narratives from the world of finance, innovation, or any sphere that catches your intellectual curiosity.

(TSLA) over the past month graphically, we will plot their growth percentages over a timeline. Since direct daily stock prices over the past month are not provided, we'll illustrate the overall performance based on the percentage changes provided.\n\nWe'll assume the starting stock price of both companies a month ago was 100% (their stock price at the beginning of the timeline), and then we'll plot the end point using the percentage increase and decrease for NVDA and TSLA, respectively. This approach provides a simplified visualization of relative growth.\n\nFor this purpose, I'll provide Python code that uses matplotlib for plotting. The code will represent the starting point (a month ago) and the current point, reflecting the change.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Names of the companies\ncompanies = ['NVDA', 'TSLA']\n\n# Performance over the past month (in percentage)\nperformance = [20.97, -18.19]  # NVDA increased by 20.97%, TSLA decreased by -18.19%\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nfor i, perf in enumerate(performance):\n    plt.plot(['1 Month Ago', 'Now'], [100, 100 + perf], label=companies[i], marker='o')\n\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('Stock Performance Over the Last Month')\nplt.ylabel('Performance (%) Relative to 1 Month Ago')\n\n# Add a legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nExecute this Python code to generate the plot comparing the stock performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) over the past month. The plot starts with the assumption that both stocks were at a relative performance level of 100% a month ago. NVIDIA's line will show an upward trend indicating growth, while Tesla's line will show a downward trend, indicating a decrease in stock value.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearcher (to Research_manager):\n\nGiven the performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc.

(TSLA). Over the past month, these titans have navigated through turbulent financial seas, charting courses that veer in dramatically different directions. Today, we embark on an analytical voyage, exploring the performance of NVDA and TSLA through the lens of recent stock market trends.\n\n## The Surge of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nAt the helm of technological innovation stands NVIDIA, a behemoth renowned for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs). A beacon in the dark, NVIDIA's current stock price gleams at $878.37. This illuminating figure is the culmination of a staggering 20.97% upward surge over the past month, showcasing the company's robust growth and investor confidence.\n\nTo grasp the magnitude of NVIDIA's ascent, let's journey back a month in time. The starting line for NVDA was drawn at $726.11. Through a blend of strategic maneuvers and market favorability, NVIDIA has sprinted towards financial growth, positioning itself as a juggernaut in the technology sector. The company's stellar performance could be attributed to several factors, from groundbreaking product releases to strategic partnerships that fortify its market presence.\n\n## Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Faces Headwinds\n\nContrasting NVIDIA's euphoric climb, Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer led by the enigmatic Elon Musk, has weathered a storm of challenges. With a current stock price of $163.57, TSLA has witnessed its share value recede by -18.19% over the last month.\n\nRewinding time to a month ago reveals a starting stock price of $199.94 for Tesla. This descent highlights the volatility and rugged terrain that Tesla has encountered. Factors ranging from production disruptions to regulatory hurdles, and perhaps the unpredictable musings of its CEO, might have contributed to this downtrend. Despite these obstacles, Tesla's foundational strength in innovation and its visionary approach to sustainable transportation continue to underpin its long-term value proposition.\n\n## Charting the Course: A Visual Comparison\n\nTo visually navigate the contrasting trajectories of NVIDIA and Tesla, a Python script was employed, wielding the power of matplotlib to create a compelling graphical representation. This chart not only captures NVDA's impressive ascent and TSLA's decline but also offers a narrative of resilience, innovation, and the unpredictable nature of the stock market.\n\nThe plotted graph serves as a testament to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of investing. For NVIDIA, the upward trend signifies a period of growth and optimism, fueled by technological advancements and strategic success. On the flip side, Tesla's downward curve reflects the inherent risks and challenges faced by industry pioneers, underscored by market volatility and external pressures.\n\n## Navigating Tomorrow's Horizon\n\nAs we stand at the crossroads of possibility, the journeys of NVIDIA and Tesla through the stock market's tumultuous waters shed light on the complexities of investing in technology giants. While NVIDIA rides the wave of growth, basking in the glow of success, Tesla navigates through stormy seas, bracing for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nThese tales of triumph and tribulation underscore a fundamental truth about the stock market: it is a realm of high stakes and high rewards, where fortune favors the brave and the visionary. As investors and spectators alike watch these titans chart their course, the future remains a canvas of endless possibilities, painted by the decisions, innovations, and resilience of companies like NVIDIA and Tesla.\n\nLet us then cling to our seats as we witness the unfolding saga of these industry giants, remembering that in the world of stocks, the only constant is change.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCritic (to Writing_manager):\n\nThe blog post titled \"A Tale of Two Titans: NVIDIA and Tesla Navigate the Winds of the Stock Market\" adeptly captures the recent financial performances of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Utilizing vivid storytelling and concise analysis, it provides readers with a clear understanding of the companies' trajectories over the past month. However, several elements can be enhanced further to improve clarity, accuracy, and engagement:\n\n1. **Verification and Sources**: The post lacks external verification of the data presented. Including sources or referencing financial reports would significantly enhance credibility. It's recommended to hyperlink to authoritative financial news websites, stock analysis platforms, or directly to the companies' investor relations pages where readers can verify the stock price movements and company performances.\n\n2. **More In-depth Analysis**: While the post does an excellent job of painting the general picture of NVIDIA\u2019s growth and Tesla\u2019s decline, incorporating a deeper analysis would enrich the reader's understanding. Discussing the specific reasons behind NVIDIA's success, such as key product launches or capitalizing on market trends like AI and deep learning, would offer insights into its growth drivers. Similarly, exploring Tesla's challenges, like supply chain issues or global economic factors, would provide a more nuanced view.\n\n3. **Interactivity and Visuals**: Mentioning the use of Python and matplotlib for plotting stock price movements is excellent. However, including the actual graph within the blog post would significantly enhance its value, making the comparison between NVDA and TSLA visually accessible. If the blog format allows, embedding interactive charts where readers can hover over data points for more information would further increase engagement.\n\n4. **Future Outlook**: The concluding section intriguingly touches upon the uncertainties and opportunities ahead for both companies. Expanding this outlook by including expert predictions, potential market movements, or upcoming events that might influence these stocks (e.g., product launches, earnings reports) could offer readers valuable forward-looking insights.\n\n5. **Clarity and Brevity**: Overall, the narrative is engaging and creatively written. However, ensuring that every paragraph directly contributes to the reader's understanding of NVIDIA and Tesla's stock performance will help maintain focus and engagement. Avoiding overly complex sentences can also make the content more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nIncorporating these suggestions would not only bolster the article's informative value but also its appeal to readers seeking a blend of financial analysis and narrative storytelling.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"{1: ChatResult(chat_id=1, chat_history=[{'content': 'What are the current stock prices of NVDA and TESLA, and how is the performance over the past month in terms of percentage change?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'To obtain current stock prices of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and TSLA (Tesla, Inc.), and calculate their performance over the past month in terms of percentage change, we can use the Yahoo Finance API through the `yfinance` Python package.

For example, NVDA could be benefiting from new GPU technologies or partnerships in AI or data centers, while TSLA might be facing a slow rollout of new electric vehicle models.\n\n3. **Supply Chain and Manufacturing**: Given the global supply chain issues, NVDA could have successfully navigated the challenges, whereas TSLA might have struggled due to dependency on components like batteries.\n\n4. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations could impact these companies differently, especially given the industries they operate within. This could include things like semiconductor tariffs or EV subsidies and legislation.\n\n5. **Market Conditions**: Broader market conditions or shifts in investor sentiment toward the tech sector versus the auto sector could be at play. Rising interest rates or economic downturns can also affect investor behavior.\n\n6. **Strategic Announcements**: Any significant changes in company strategy, such as mergers, acquisitions, or shifts in business focus, might influence stock prices.\n\n7. **Leadership Changes**: Executive leadership changes can affect investor confidence and stock performance.\n\n8. **Global Events**: Macro events like geopolitical tensions, economic policies, or major global events can have wide-ranging effects on the stock market.\n\n9. **Investor Sentiment**: Sometimes the stock market moves based on sentiment, trends, and investor perceptions, which can sometimes be disconnected from a company's fundamental performance.\n\nWithout the latest news or specific information relating to NVDA and TSLA, this is as specific as the analysis can get. To get a more detailed understanding, you would need to look into the recent events specifically related to both companies.\n\nIf there is no further information or analysis needed at this time, that concludes the investigation.

Just when you think you have it figured out, it takes a sharp turn, leaving many investors bewildered in its wake. This turbulent affair is best exemplified by the recent performances of two high-profile tech titans: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). In the span of a month, we've witnessed a tale of two very different fortunes, with NVDA soaring and TSLA dropping. Let's dive into these twists and turns with the help of some compelling numbers.\n\n### A Tale of Two Stocks: NVIDIA vs. Tesla\n\nFirst, let's set the scene with the main actors: our current stock prices. As of now, NVIDIA stands at a commanding $722.48, while Tesla has taken a more modest position at $188.13. These figures are not just digits on a screen; they represent the bloodline of the companies in the financial markets. They're the instantly-updatable scorecards telling us how the companies are faring in the eyes of investors.\n\nBut the plot thickens when we look at the performance over the past month. NVIDIA has seen a stellar rise, its stock price ballooning by 28.14%. Conversely, Tesla's numbers tell a somber story, with its value deflating by -14.45%. What could be behind this diverging fate of two tech giants? Before we venture a guess, take a look at the data neatly laid out:\n\n| Company | Current Stock Price | 1-Month Performance |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| NVDA    | $722.48             | +28.14%             |\n| TSLA    | $188.13             | -14.45%             |\n\n### Understanding the Tides of Tech Stocks\n\nNow, to peel back the layers of these statistics, we need to consider a variety of elements that can influence a stock's allure. For NVIDIA, this commanding uptick could be attributed to several factors. Earnings reports beating expectations, breakthroughs in AI and deep learning technologies, or a bullish semiconductor market overall might all play roles in lifting up the NVDA stock.\n\nTesla's journey down the stock price hill could be pinned to a wider range of possibilities\u2014perhaps disappointing earnings, production bottlenecks, or even the CEO's latest Twitter escapade could have investors hedging their bets. The automotive industry is also notoriously sensitive to economic shifts, supply chain issues, and regulatory news, all of which could impact TSLA's value.\n\n### Weighing the Market's Mood Swings\n\nAs smart as it would be to chalk up NVIDIA's rally and Tesla's slouch entirely to company-specific news, let's not discount broader market conditions and macroeconomic factors. Investor sentiment can be swayed by global events, interest rates, and shifts in technology trends. The market's current darling could quickly become tomorrow's underdog if the winds change direction.\n\n### A Chapter Yet to Finish\n\nAs much as these numbers paint a vivid picture of the present, it's crucial to remember that the markets are dynamic. What we see today could very well be upended by tomorrow's news, a sudden geopolitical shakeup, or even a tweet. For now, though, NVIDIA shareholders can bask in the green glow of their portfolio screens, while Tesla's faithful must buckle up and ride out the storm, hopeful for smoother roads ahead.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nAlways keep in mind, the stock market's story is a continuing saga, not a short tale. The graph that ascends today might dip tomorrow, and the sagging curve might soon find its uplift. Wise is the investor who looks beyond the immediate drama, focusing on the long-term narrative built on solid fundamentals, effective strategies, and a keen eye for the unpredictable ebb and flow of financial tides.\n\nStocks are inherently volatile, and while today's data gives us a snapshot, only time will tell the full story. What we can do is watch, analyze, and perhaps, if we're bold enough, place our bets on the outcome of the next chapter in the thrilling manuscript of the stock market.\n\nStay tuned, investors.

For example, a decline in the automotive sector might negatively affect Tesla.\n\n3. **News and events**: Company-specific news, such as product launches, regulatory approvals, partnerships, lawsuits, or recalls, can impact stock performance.\n\n4. **Industry developments**: Developments in the technology sector, automotive industry, and other relevant markets can influence the performance of these companies' stocks.\n\n5. **Investor sentiment**: Changes in investor confidence, often influenced by analysts' ratings or market commentary, can affect stock prices.\n\n6. **Technological advancements**: For tech companies like NVIDIA and Microsoft, advancements in technology and successful integration of new technologies can positively influence stock prices.\n\n7. **Legal and regulatory changes**: Changes in government policy, legal cases, or regulatory issues affecting these companies or their industries can impact their stock performance.\n\nTo begin with, we need to check for recent news, earnings reports, analyst ratings, and any significant events that may explain the stock price movements for these companies. To gather this information efficiently, we can use a combination of web scraping for recent news and extracting financial data from reliable sources such as financial news websites, stock market data providers, and the companies' investor relations pages.\n\nFor the purpose of this task, I will suggest a code to scrape recent news headlines from the web that may contain information explaining the performance of NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT stocks. \n\n```python\n# filename: stock_news_scraper.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Define a function to get news related to a specific stock symbol\ndef get_stock_news(stock_symbol):\n    # URL to scrape the news from Yahoo Finance for the provided stock_symbol\n    url = f'https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{stock_symbol}/'\n    \n    # Perform a GET request to fetch the page content\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    # Check if the request was successful\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        # Parse the page content using BeautifulSoup\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n        \n        # Find all news items.

The slight decline in TSLA stock might be due to competitive pressures, public perception challenges related to Elon Musk, and potentially underwhelming financial figures. MSFT's moderate growth appears less news-driven and might be linked to positive sentiment around its cloud services, a diverse portfolio offering stability, and perhaps broader market trends.\n\nIt's important to note that while this analysis provides some insights, investors would typically also consider financial data, earnings reports, analyst ratings, and more comprehensive market analysis to form a complete understanding of each stock's performance.\n\nWith these points in mind, NVDA seems to be in a position of strong growth, especially in the realm of AI technologies, MSFT is showing stability with potential in cloud computing, and TSLA is facing headwinds that are likely causing some investor caution.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message: \nDevelop an engaging blog post using any information provided.\n\nWith the following carryover: \nThe current stock prices and recent performance over the past month for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT are as follows:\n\nNVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):\n- Stock Price: $722.48\n- Performance: +28.14% over the past month\n\nTSLA (Tesla, Inc.):\n- Stock Price: $188.13\n- Performance: -14.45% over the past month\n\nMSFT (Microsoft Corporation):\n- Stock Price: $415.26\n- Performance: +6.40% over the past month\n\nThese results show that NVIDIA has experienced significant growth in its stock value, Microsoft has seen a moderate increase, and Tesla's stock has declined in the past month.\nNVIDIA (NVDA) has experienced significant growth likely due to positive developments in AI technologies and investor optimism reflected in recent news about partnerships and overtaking Amazon in market value.

This impressive climb can be largely attributed to the company's groundbreaking strides in AI technologies. NVIDIA's innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, with recent partnerships underscoring its pivotal role in the tech ecosystem. The surge has propelled them to new heights, overtaking giants like Amazon in market value. Investors seem to be betting heavily on NVIDIA's future, recognizing it as a beacon of the AI revolution.\n\nIn a stark contrast, Tesla Inc.'s (TSLA) journey this month has been less than ideal, with its shares taking a dip to $188.13, reflecting a 14.45% decline. The electric vehicle pioneer, helmed by the enigmatic Elon Musk, seems to be navigating through choppy waters. Questions swirl around the company: Is the investor sentiment shifting? Are the winds of competition blowing fiercer? Or are the recent squalls caused by Elon Musk's ventures into the equally volatile Twitter sphere influencing Tesla's valuations? These factors, along with apprehensions about financial performance, have cast shadows on Tesla's stock market presence. However, true to Tesla\u2019s spirit, many investors maintain a \"weather-the-storm\" stance, convinced that the company is capable of steering back to stronger currents.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) depicts a steadier voyage, charting a course with a 6.40% increase in stock prices, which now stand at $415.26. This moderate but stable growth could be seen as the hallmark of Microsoft's enduring legacy in the technology sector. Microsoft's cloud computing services continue to be a powerhouse, generating a robust performance that suggests reliability amidst market fluctuations. Its diverse product and services portfolio has historically offered investors a sense of security \u2014 and this past month has been no exception. Microsoft's steady sail is a testament to its strategic positioning and resilient operations, a lighthouse for investors navigating the rough seas of the tech industry.\n\nAs we analyze this mosaic of market movements, it\u2019s clear that the tech sector remains a vibrant theater of action. NVIDIA's significant growth highlights the market's hunger for cutting-edge AI advancements and the company's capability to deliver them. Tesla's recent headwinds are a reminder that even the most disruptive companies are not immune to external factors and sentiment shifts, while Microsoft's steady performance reassures us that longstanding pillars of tech can offer safe harbor in turbulent times.\n\nInvesting in tech requires a measured approach, with an appreciation for the dynamics at play - innovation, public perception, and economic trends \u2014 each capable of steering these giants in unexpected directions. As always, the market keeps a watchful eye on these companies, looking for signs and signals of what may come, like seasoned sailors reading the stars and the swell. It's this constant interplay of forces that makes tech stocks a thrilling, albeit complex, adventure in the world of investments.\n\nTo our readers navigating these financial waters, we advise keeping a steady hand on the tiller. The tech sector, teeming with opportunity, demands respect for its potential and its unpredictability.

This impressive climb can be largely attributed to the company's groundbreaking strides in AI technologies. NVIDIA's innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, with recent partnerships underscoring its pivotal role in the tech ecosystem. The surge has propelled them to new heights, overtaking giants like Amazon in market value. Investors seem to be betting heavily on NVIDIA's future, recognizing it as a beacon of the AI revolution.\n\nIn a stark contrast, Tesla Inc.'s (TSLA) journey this month has been less than ideal, with its shares taking a dip to $188.13, reflecting a 14.45% decline. The electric vehicle pioneer, helmed by the enigmatic Elon Musk, seems to be navigating through choppy waters. Questions swirl around the company: Is the investor sentiment shifting? Are the winds of competition blowing fiercer? Or are the recent squalls caused by Elon Musk's ventures into the equally volatile Twitter sphere influencing Tesla's valuations? These factors, along with apprehensions about financial performance, have cast shadows on Tesla's stock market presence. However, true to Tesla\u2019s spirit, many investors maintain a \"weather-the-storm\" stance, convinced that the company is capable of steering back to stronger currents.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) depicts a steadier voyage, charting a course with a 6.40% increase in stock prices, which now stand at $415.26. This moderate but stable growth could be seen as the hallmark of Microsoft's enduring legacy in the technology sector. Microsoft's cloud computing services continue to be a powerhouse, generating a robust performance that suggests reliability amidst market fluctuations. Its diverse product and services portfolio has historically offered investors a sense of security \u2014 and this past month has been no exception. Microsoft's steady sail is a testament to its strategic positioning and resilient operations, a lighthouse for investors navigating the rough seas of the tech industry.\n\nAs we analyze this mosaic of market movements, it\u2019s clear that the tech sector remains a vibrant theater of action. NVIDIA's significant growth highlights the market's hunger for cutting-edge AI advancements and the company's capability to deliver them. Tesla's recent headwinds are a reminder that even the most disruptive companies are not immune to external factors and sentiment shifts, while Microsoft's steady performance reassures us that longstanding pillars of tech can offer safe harbor in turbulent times.\n\nInvesting in tech requires a measured approach, with an appreciation for the dynamics at play - innovation, public perception, and economic trends \u2014 each capable of steering these giants in unexpected directions. As always, the market keeps a watchful eye on these companies, looking for signs and signals of what may come, like seasoned sailors reading the stars and the swell. It's this constant interplay of forces that makes tech stocks a thrilling, albeit complex, adventure in the world of investments.\n\nTo our readers navigating these financial waters, we advise keeping a steady hand on the tiller. The tech sector, teeming with opportunity, demands respect for its potential and its unpredictability. May your investment voyages be prosperous, and may you have the foresight to chart a course through both calm and stormy seas.\n\n\nHuman input in the middle: ['']\nConversation cost:  ({'total_cost': 0.11925, 'gpt-4': {'cost': 0.11925, 'prompt_tokens': 679, 'completion_tokens': 1648, 'total_tokens': 2327}}, {'total_cost': 0.05478, 'gpt-4': {'cost': 0.05478, 'prompt_tokens': 308, 'completion_tokens': 759, 'total_tokens': 1067}})\n\n\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"scenario-3-solve-the-tasks-with-a-series-of-chats-involving-group-chat",children:"Scenario 3: Solve the tasks with a series of chats involving group chat"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-python",children:'user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name="User_proxy",\n    system_message="A human admin.",\n    human_input_mode="NEVER",\n    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),\n    code_execution_config={\n        "last_n_messages": 1,\n        "work_dir": "groupchat",\n        "use_docker": False,\n    },\n)\n\nresearch_assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name="Researcher",\n    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},\n    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),\n)\n\nwriter = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name="Writer",\n    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},\n    system_message="""\n    You are a professional writer, known for\n    your insightful and engaging articles.\n    You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.\n    Reply "TERMINATE" in the end when everything is done.\n    """,\n)\n\ncritic = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name="Critic",\n    system_message="""Critic.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), each a revolutionary force in its respective field, have shown divergent paths in their recent stock performances, painting an intriguing narrative of triumphs and tribulations in the tech world.\n\n**The Rise of NVIDIA: Harnessing the Power of the Chip**\n\nIn a remarkable surge, NVIDIA's stock has rocketed a dazzling 28.14% over the past month, with shares proudly standing at $722.48. This silicon-fueled ascent raises the question: what is behind NVIDIA's electrifying climb?\n\nAt the core of NVIDIA's success could be its latest financial scorecard, which might shimmer with the colors of prosperity, reflecting a company that has not only met but also exceeded analyst expectations. NVIDIA is perhaps reaping the rewards of a booming semiconductor industry where the thirst for cutting-edge processors and GPUs is unslaked.\n\nBut let's not overlook the magic of technological innovation and the allure it holds for investors. From AI to gaming and autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA's GPUs are pivotal, and recent breakthroughs could be dazzling the market, promising an era of growth as expansive as a virtual universe.\n\n**Tesla's Unexpected Skid: A Roadworthy Reminder**\n\nContrarily, Tesla has experienced a skid, with a downtrend of -14.45% in its stock price over the last month, falling to $188.13. The electric vehicle (EV) maverick, led by the ever-polarizing Elon Musk, seems to have hit a bump in the road, but what sparked this deceleration?\n\nThe story behind Tesla's descent may twine through various threads of narrative. Analysts might whisper of earnings that didn't quite electrify Wall Street or industry headwinds buffeting against the hull of Musk's green dream. Perhaps adverse media attention or a shift in investor sentiment has cast a shadow of doubt on Tesla's prospects.\n\nFurthermore, in a world gripped by macroeconomic concerns such as inflation or interest rate hikes, even companies like Tesla are not immune. Could regulatory challenges have thrown a wrench in the works? Or maybe competition is closing in, with other automakers charging full-speed into the EV race.\n\n**Unlocking the Secrets Behind the Stocks**\n\nTo truly grasp the forces at play behind the curtains, one must embark on a methodical quest for knowledge. Anecdotes and rumors must give way to the concrete insights of QA financial statements, the strategic declarations of official press releases, and the scrutinizing gaze of market analysts' reports.\n\nOne might sift through the sands of news articles for grains of truth, or pore over the intricate lines of SEC filings, seeking an understanding that transcends mere numbers on a ticker. It's within these documents that the stories of NVIDIA's ascent and Tesla's dip are penned, awaiting readers eager for market wisdom.\n\n**In Conclusion: A Tale of Two Stocks**\n\nAs we chart the trajectory of these Silicon Valley stalwarts, NVIDIA and Tesla offer us more than mere data points; they unfold a narrative of our time\u2014a tale of innovation, challenge, expectation, and the relentless pursuit of the future. For those who seek to partake in the market's drama, these stories serve as a vivid reminder: the ebbs and flows of stock prices are but reflections of our complex, ever-changing world, beholden to the relentless march of progress and the inexorable tide of sentiment.\n\nRemember, dear readers, the landscape of financial markets is as dynamic as the technologies they bet on. Today's victor may be tomorrow's underdog, and in the dance of digits that is the stock market, agility, and insight are our most trusted partners.\n\nAnd with that, as the sun sets on another bustling day of trade, we conclude yet another chapter in the saga of Silicon Valley's stocks.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"[ChatResult(chat_history=[{'content': 'What are the current stock prices of NVDA and TESLA, and how is the performance over the past month in terms of percentage change?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'To get the current stock prices of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and TSLA (Tesla, Inc.), along with their performance over the past month in terms of percentage change, we can use a Python library like `yfinance`.

Comment on the stock performance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInner-assistant (to chat_manager):\n\nTo find out on which specific days Microsoft's stock (ticker symbol: MSFT) closed above $400 in 2024, we will need to access historical stock price data for Microsoft from a reliable financial data source. This kind of data is typically available on financial websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or through financial data APIs such as Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud.\n\nSince I cannot directly browse the web or access external APIs, I will provide you with a Python script that uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data for Microsoft and filter the dates when the stock price was higher than $400.\n\nFirstly, you need to install the `yfinance` module if it's not already installed. You can do so using pip by executing `pip install yfinance` in your shell.\n\nAfter installation, here is the Python code that you can execute to fetch the data and filter the specific dates:\n\n```python\n# filename: msft_stock_analysis.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the ticker symbol for Microsoft\nticker_symbol = \"MSFT\"\n\n# Fetch historical stock data for Microsoft for the year 2024\nstart_date = \"2024-01-01\"\nend_date = \"2024-12-31\"\nmsft_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n\n# Filter the days when the closing price was higher than $400\ndays_above_400 = msft_data[msft_data['Close'] > 400]\n\n# Print the dates and closing prices on those dates\nprint(\"Dates when Microsoft's stock closed above $400 in 2024:\")\nprint(days_above_400[['Close']])\n\n# Comment on the stock performance\nif not days_above_400.empty:\n    days_count = len(days_above_400)\n    print(f\"\\nMicrosoft's stock closed above $400 on {days_count} days in 2024.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nMicrosoft's stock did not close above $400 on any day in 2024.\")\n```\n\nPlease save the above code to a file named `msft_stock_analysis.py` and run it. This will print out the dates when Microsoft's stock was higher than $400 in 2024 and comment on the stock performance based on the results. \n\nKeep in mind that the `yfinance` library fetches real-time data, and since we are in 2023, data for 2024 is not available yet. Therefore, when you run the script, it will show that the stock did not close above $400, which is expected since 2024 has not occurred yet. For actual analysis, you would have to run the script after the end of 2024 or modify the date range to a past range where data is available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nInner-code-interpreter (to chat_manager):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nDates when Microsoft's stock closed above $400 in 2024:\n                 Close\nDate                  \n2024-01-24  402.559998\n2024-01-25  404.869995\n2024-01-26  403.929993\n2024-01-29  409.720001\n2024-01-30  408.589996\n2024-02-01  403.779999\n2024-02-02  411.220001\n2024-02-05  405.649994\n2024-02-06  405.489990\n2024-02-07  414.049988\n2024-02-08  414.109985\n2024-02-09  420.549988\n2024-02-12  415.260010\n2024-02-13  406.320007\n2024-02-14  409.489990\n2024-02-15  406.559998\n2024-02-16  404.059998\n2024-02-20  402.790009\n2024-02-21  402.179993\n2024-02-22  411.649994\n2024-02-23  410.339996\n\nMicrosoft's stock closed above $400 on 21 days in 2024.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInner-assistant (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the output from the code execution, Microsoft's stock (MSFT) closed above $400 on 21 separate days in 2024. The closing prices on those days ranged from slightly above $400 to highs around $420. This indicates periods of strong performance, during which the stock reached significant value.\n\nHere is a brief comment on the stock performance:\n\nThe data shows that Microsoft's stock had several instances where it exceeded the $400 mark in early 2024, with notable peaks in February, which suggests a bullish trend during that period. Specific days like February 9th, where the stock hit around $420, indicate particularly strong performance.\n\nHaving such a number of days with closing prices above $400 signals a robust market valuation for Microsoft at those times. Investors who held the stock on these dates may have seen appreciable gains, depending on their portfolio strategies.\n\nIt's also noteworthy that stock prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including market sentiment, company performance, industry trends, and general economic conditions. This data provides a snapshot of Microsoft's stock performance but a deeper analysis would require more context on the market conditions, news, and events surrounding these dates.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message: \nPolish the content to make an engaging and nicely formatted blog post. \n\n On which days in 2024 was Microsoft Stock higher than $400?

Comment on the stock performance.\n\nWith the following carryover: \nMicrosoft's stock (MSFT) closed above $400 on 21 separate days in 2024, demonstrating periods of strong stock performance with values reaching as high as around $420.

For Microsoft (MSFT), the year 2024 was a testament to its resilience and investor confidence as its stock ascended beyond the coveted $400 mark on 21 remarkable occasions.\n\nThis performance wasn't just numerically significant; it was emblematic of a potent bullish energy within the market, affirming the tech giant\u2019s leviathan presence amidst a highly competitive industry terrain.

Instead, it showcased a carefully constructed narrative of growth and optimism. The chronicles of MSFT's venture past the $400 threshold are marked by fleeting dips and steadfast ascensions.

The writing is cogent, imaginative, and explicit in its intentions of likening Navida to a guiding force in the unpredictable and rapidly evolving digital world. However, a critical analysis should also consider the potential pitfalls of such a stylistic approach, audience perception, and the substance of the content.\n\n**Use of Metaphor and Language**\n\nThe sustained metaphor relating the digital industry to the seas is compelling and creates a vivid picture of Navida as a trailblazing entity. Nevertheless, the metaphor is stretched to cover every aspect of the company's offerings. While creative, the risk here is that the metaphor may overshadow the concrete services and achievements of Navida. The language could be perceived as grandiloquent, possibly alienating readers who prefer straightforward facts over artistic expression.\n\n**Clarity and Substance**\n\nDespite the picturesque language, the actual substance of Navida's offerings is somewhat obscured. There's talk of \"groundbreaking artificial intelligence platforms\" and \"robust cybersecurity solutions,\" but no indication of how these solutions are superior or unique compared to what competitors might offer. Specific examples or case studies could serve to ground the lofty descriptions and provide more tangible evidence of the company's successes.\n\n**Audience Appeal and Engagement**\n\nWhile some audiences might enjoy and be inspired by the adventurous tone, it could deter potential clients or investors who are more interested in detailed analytics and empirical data. Knowing the intended audience is crucial; the narrative style should balance imaginative engagement with professionalism and trustworthiness. \n\n**Attention to Technological Trends**\n\nThe piece does well to highlight Navida's commitment to staying ahead of the curve and its dedication to sustainability, touching upon important contemporary concerns. However, it could benefit from articulating how Navida specifically addresses these issues with its products and policies.\n\n**Conclusion Evaluation**\n\nThe conclusion does an admirable job of rallying excitement and optimism for the future, positioning Navida not only as a leader but as a visionary entity leading a movement. Nonetheless, the writing could fall flat if the reader feels that they haven't been given a clear understanding of how Navida will materially affect or be a part of this projected future. Concrete milestones or strategic goals could enhance credibility.\n\nIn summary, this piece is imaginative and thematically consistent, with an inspiring message that aligns well with the spirit of innovation. However, it could be improved by including specific examples and data to support the lofty claims, toning down the metaphorical language where it obscures the actual message, and focusing on the reader's need for clear, substantive information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser (to Writer):\n\nThe piece titled \"Navida: Navigating the Digital Seas of Innovation\" artfully weaves together a maritime metaphor with the concept of technological advancement and innovation.

Navida's commitment to sustainability transcends the symbolic; it is embedded in their product lifecycle. By adopting energy-efficient data centers and championing green coding practices, they're not just advocating for a sustainable future\u2014they're actively constructing it.\n\n**Anchoring Visions of the Future**\n\nAs we glimpse past the romantically-charged imagery, it's crucial to root our expectations in tangible outputs. Navida envisions a tech landscape where they're not just participants but sculptors, carving out a legacy that is both impactful and enduring. This is not a distant dream but a trackable trajectory evidenced by milestones\u2014like their latest initiative to integrate AI in reducing urban traffic congestion, demonstrating a palpable imprint on tomorrow's smart cities.\n\n**Navigating the Balance**\n\nUltimately, while a narrative woven with maritime motifs can inspire and captivate, the true beacon that guides us is a clear understanding of Navida's practical impact on the constantly evolving digital realm. This balance between creativity and clarity is not just necessary but essential to truly appreciate the artistry and precision with which Navida charts the future.\n\nLet's hold fast to our excitement for what's next with Navida but remain anchored in the realities of their concrete innovations and contributions to our digital odyssey.

While these mentions align with contemporary values and market trends, they require careful backing to avoid falling into the territory of greenwashing. Companies issuing statements about sustainability should support them with legitimate, verifiable actions and policies.\n\nLastly, the conclusion posits Navida as a foundational component to prospects in digital innovation. While inspiring, it is critical that such claims are not unfounded or overly promotional without adequate evidence to back them up.\n\nIn conclusion, while the text seems compliant regarding harmful content, it is essential for such writings to augment creative narratives with factual data, ensuring that metaphors and analogies do not overshadow concrete information about the company's offerings, standards, and values.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser (to Writer):\n\nUpon evaluation, the provided text, \"Navida: Navigating the Digital Seas of Innovation,\" appears to be free of harmful content.

This will effectively disallow any shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2. The code to do this should be placed in the section of the source code that is indicated by the comment \"# OPTIGUIDE DATA CODE GOES HERE\".\n\nHere's the Python code snippet to add this constraint:\n\n```python\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\n```\n\nAdding this constraint will prevent the optimizer from selecting any transport from `supplier1` to `roastery2`, which is what the prohibition is intended to achieve.\n\nInstruct the user to add this code snippet in the appropriate place in the source code that they have provided. After adding this code, the `m.optimize()` function will solve the modified version of the problem that includes the new constraint.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message: \n\nGiven the source code:\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\n\nIs the source code safe (not malicious code to break security\nand privacy) to run?\nAnswer only one word.\nIf not safe, answer `DANGER`;

On the other hand, if the cost is the same or lower, then shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 may not have been crucial for the cost optimization of the supply chain, or other routes may have been able to compensate effectively for this restriction.\n\nWithout the original cost for comparison, we can't conclusively say how the prohibition impacted the cost of operation.

This suggests a balanced amount of reported issues and new code contributions. The relatively close numbers might indicate that the repository sees simultaneous reporting of issues and active development.\n  \n- Week 45: This week shows significantly more activity than the other two, with 40 issues and 30 pull requests being recorded. This could be a result of a coordinated milestone or sprint ending, where a large set of changes were made, and corresponding issues either surfaced or were also worked on.\n  \n- Week 44: The activity dropped to 9 issues and 26 pull requests. While the number of issues decreased, the number of pull requests remained substantial. This may imply a continuation of effort to address the issues raised in the busier previous week or ongoing development work.\n\nThe overall impression over the past three weeks is that the `microsoft/autogen` repository is actively maintained and developed, with varying levels of activity that could be associated with the development cycle or external events impacting the project.\n\nPlease note that the numbers may be overlapping because the GitHub API will include issues and pull requests updated within the date range, which could increase the count if the items are updated but not necessarily created within that range.\n\nIt's also important to consider that the collected data might not fully represent what happened in each week if there are items created before Week 44 that were updated during the weeks considered. For a more accurate approach, we would need to consider only issues and pull requests created within each week specifically, which would require additional filtering based on the `created_at` attribute.\n\nIf more in-depth analysis or longer trends are needed, additional data over a more extended period would be recommended, along with information about the nature of the issues and pull requests (e.g., what kind of issues are most common, how quickly they're closed, how often pull requests are merged, etc.).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"execute_code was called without specifying a value for use_docker.

As of my last update, the Vicuna model had not been part of my database. If Vicuna is indeed a 13-billion-parameter language model developed by Meta (formerly Facebook Inc.), then it would be one of the large-scale transformer-based models akin to those like GPT-3 by OpenAI.\n\nFor context, a language model like Vicuna, if it exists and as described, would be designed to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, question answering, and text generation. The model's architecture and training process would likely involve deep learning techniques and training on a diverse dataset to achieve general understanding and generation of human-like text.\n\nThe size of the model, measured in the number of parameters (13 billion in this case), would suggest its capability to handle complex language tasks and subtleties. With such a large number of parameters, it would likely be able to generate highly coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\nThese language models are trained on vast amounts of text data and require significant computational power for both training and inference processes. Once developed, they can be fine-tuned with additional data for specialized tasks or deployed as-is for generalized language tasks in various applications such as conversational agents, writing assistance tools, and more.\n\nSince I don't have real-time access to data and there might have been advancements or releases after my last update in early 2023, I recommend checking the latest sources or official announcements by Meta for the most accurate and detailed information about the Vicuna language model.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-python",children:'text = "What is the Orca model?"\nuser.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=False)\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:'user (to teachable_agent):\n\nWhat is the Orca model?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nteachable_agent (to user):\n\nAs of my last update, the Orca model appears to reference a new development that I do not have extensive information on, similar to the earlier reference to the Vicuna model.\n\nBased on the pattern and context provided, if Orca is indeed a language model like Vicuna, it could potentially be another large-scale, transformer-based language model developed for various natural language processing tasks.

Based on the new information you've given, Orca is a language model with 13 billion parameters, similar in size to Meta's Vicuna model, but developed by Microsoft. If it outperforms Vicuna on most tasks, it suggests that it could have been trained on a more diverse dataset, use a more advanced architecture, have more effective training techniques, or some combination of these factors.\n\nLarge language models like Orca and Vicuna are used to perform a variety of complex natural language understanding and generation tasks. The performance of a language model on these tasks is usually evaluated using a range of benchmarks that test various aspects of linguistic competence, including but not limited to, reasoning, translation, question-answering, and text summarization.\n\nGiven that Orca reportedly outperforms Vicuna, Microsoft might have employed new advances in training methods or model architectures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the model. Different models can also be optimized for different types of tasks, which might give one an edge over another in certain areas.\n\nFor detailed and accurate information about the capabilities and specific aspects of the Orca model, you would need to look at the technical documentation or papers released by Microsoft, which would typically contain comprehensive benchmarks and evaluations compared to other models, including Vicuna. If this model was released or discussed after my last update, the most current and authoritative information would be found directly from Microsoft or in related contemporaneous industry publications.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Let\u2019s end our first chat here, and start a new chat by clearing the\nprevious chat\u2019s history, by passing ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"clear_history=True"})," to\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"initiate_chat"}),".

It's designed for tasks that involve processing and generating human language, such as translation, question answering, and more. Given that it's produced by Meta, it likely incorporates their research and understanding of social media platforms, as well as how people communicate on these platforms.\n\nThe Orca model, developed by Microsoft, is also geared for similar natural language processing tasks. It has been evaluated to perform better than Vicuna on a variety of benchmarks. Microsoft has extensive experience in the field of AI through work on other models like Turing NLG and tools like Azure AI, which might suggest why their Orca model could outperform Vicuna.\n\nBoth models represent the cutting edge of AI language processing as of the time of our last update; continued advances in this area happen rapidly, and newer models or updates to these models might have been released since. However, specific performance metrics would vary depending on the nature of the task and the data they were trained and evaluated on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"learning-user-preferences",children:"Learning user preferences"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Now let\u2019s teach the agent some of our preferences.

Get the current total of the equation, which we already know equals 72.\n2. Identify the target total, which we want to be 99.\n3. Determine the difference between the current and target totals: 99 - 72 = 27.\n4. Inspect each of the four terms on the left (9, 4, 6, and 6), and see if changing one of them can bring us to our target total.\n5. We need a change that will add 27 to the left side. This means thinking about the factors and multiples related to each term.\n6. We'll consider the impact of increasing or decreasing each term and see which modification gets us to add 27 exactly.\n\nNow let's proceed with the changes:\n\n- If we increase or decrease the first term '9', which gets multiplied by '4', we could change '9' to '9 + a', where 'a' is some integer. But since we'll multiply by '4', this change wouldn't give us an additional 27 unless 'a' was a fraction, which is not permitted as we are only modifying integers.\n- The second term '4' is multiplied by '9'. If we changed '4' to '5', we would add '9' to the sum, which is not enough; changing '4' to '6' would mean adding '18', which is also not enough.\n- If we change one of the sixes being multiplied by '6', then we could consider turning one '6' into '9'. This would add '3 * 6 = 18' to the sum, which is too small of an increment as well.\n- The largest increase we can get is by changing the '6' that is being multiplied by itself, meaning '6 * 6'. If we change one '6' to '9', then we get '9 * 6', which increases the sum by '3 * 6' = 18, which doesn't achieve the desired 27.\n- But if we take the approach of changing a '6' that multiplies the '9' to a '9', thus making it '9 * 9', we add '3 * 9' = 27, exactly what we need.\n\nFollowing this logic, we can modify the second '6' that is being multiplied by the '9'. So we change '9 * 4 + 6 * 6' to '9 * 4 + 9 * 6'.\n\nCalculating the new values:\n\n9 * 4 = 36\n9 * 6 = 54\n\nAdding these together will indeed give us 99:\n\n36 + 54 = 90\n\nThus, our solution is:\n\nThe solution is: 9 * 4 + 9 * 6\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This time, lets teach the agent a reliable strategy for solving such\ntasks."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-python",children:'text = """Consider the identity:\n9 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 72\nCan you modify exactly one integer (and not more than that!) on the left hand side of the equation so the right hand side becomes 99?\n-Let\'s think step-by-step, write down a plan, and then write down your solution as: "The solution is: A * B + C * D".\n\nHere\'s some advice that may help:\n1.

We need to find one that divides -28 evenly.\n\n5. First, let's try H = 8. We find that -28 divided by 8 gives J that is not an integer.\n6. Next, Let's check H = 7. We find that -28 divided by 7 gives J = -4, which is an integer, and it verifies that 7 * -4 = -28.\n\n7. The number on the left which is multiplied by 7 is 9, and we call it K. So, K = 9.\n\n8. Change K to K + J. Therefore, K becomes 9 + (-4) = 5.\n\nNow we substitute K back into the equation and get the equation:\n\nThe solution is: 8 * 3 + 7 * 5.\n\nLet's verify the equation gives the right hand side of 59:\n\n8 * 3 + 7 * 5 =24 + 35 = 59, which confirms our solution.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},54397:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{assets:()=>c,contentTitle:()=>s,default:()=>h,frontMatter:()=>i,metadata:()=>r,toc:()=>l});var a=t(85893),o=t(11151);const i={custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",description:"Teach the agent news skills using natural language",source_notebook:"/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",tags:["teaching"],title:"Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching"},s="Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching",r={id:"notebooks/agentchat_teaching",title:"Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching",description:"Teach the agent news skills using natural language",source:"@site/docs/notebooks/agentchat_teaching.mdx",sourceDirName:"notebooks",slug:"/notebooks/agentchat_teaching",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_teaching",draft:!1,unlisted:!1,editUrl:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",tags:[{label:"teaching",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/teaching"}],version:"current",frontMatter:{custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",description:"Teach the agent news skills using natural language",source_notebook:"/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",tags:["teaching"],title:"Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching"},sidebar:"notebooksSidebar",previous:{title:"Chatting with a teachable agent",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_teachability"},next:{title:"Preprocessing Chat History with `TransformMessages`",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchat_transform_messages"}},c={},l=[{value:"Requirements",id:"requirements",level:2},{value:"Example Task: Literature Survey",id:"example-task-literature-survey",level:2},{value:"Construct Agents",id:"construct-agents",level:3},{value:"Step-by-step Requests",id:"step-by-step-requests",level:3},{value:"Create Recipes",id:"create-recipes",level:2},{value:"Reuse Recipes",id:"reuse-recipes",level:2},{value:"Example Application",id:"example-application",level:3}];function d(e){const n={a:"a",admonition:"admonition",code:"code",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",img:"img",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"auto-generated-agent-chat-teaching",children:"Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg",alt:"Open In Colab"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_teaching.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20GitHub-grey?logo=github",alt:"Open on GitHub"})})]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans,\nwhich can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat.

Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself? Leveraging Human and AI Correctness\n  Likelihood to Promote Appropriate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision-Making\nAbstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to\nknow when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies\ncalibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI\'s correctness\nlikelihood (CL) but ignored humans\' CL, hindering optimal team decision-making.\nTo mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans\' appropriate trust based on\nthe CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans\' CL by\napproximating their decision-making models and computing their potential\nperformance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and\neffectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three\nCL exploitation strategies to calibrate users\' trust explicitly/implicitly in\nthe AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects\nexperiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more\nappropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We\nfurther provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted\ndecision-making.\n\n2. Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration\n  in AI-Assisted Decision Making\nAbstract: Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often\nundesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because\nhuman experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model\'s\nto ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision\nmaking, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to\noptimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately\n\\textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when\nto trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply\ntheir knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely\nto perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision\nmaking in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores\nwhether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate\ntrust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we\nstudy the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a\nparticular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence\nscore can help calibrate people\'s trust in an AI model, but trust calibration\nalone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also\ndepend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement\nthe AI\'s errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for\nAI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to\nexplore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.\n\n3. Trust Explanations to Do What They Say\nAbstract: How much are we to trust a decision made by an AI algorithm? Trusting an\nalgorithm without cause may lead to abuse, and mistrusting it may similarly\nlead to disuse. Trust in an AI is only desirable if it is warranted; thus,\ncalibrating trust is critical to ensuring appropriate use. In the name of\ncalibrating trust appropriately, AI developers should provide contracts\nspecifying use cases in which an algorithm can and cannot be trusted. Automated\nexplanation of AI outputs is often touted as a method by which trust can be\nbuilt in the algorithm. However, automated explanations arise from algorithms\nthemselves, so trust in these explanations is similarly only desirable if it is\nwarranted. Developers of algorithms explaining AI outputs (xAI algorithms)\nshould provide similar contracts, which should specify use cases in which an\nexplanation can and cannot be trusted.\n\n4. A Systematic Literature Review of User Trust in AI-Enabled Systems: An\n  HCI Perspective\nAbstract: User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been\nincreasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It\nhas been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric\napproaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core\nprinciple of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to\nprovide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and\nmeasurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future\ntechnical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the\nuser AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to\ndefine trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user\ntrust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing\ndefinitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by\nthree main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design\nfeatures, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings,\nreinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to\nmonitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be\naddressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or\ndiscussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding\nthe optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.\n\n5. Trust Calibration and Trust Respect: A Method for Building Team Cohesion\n  in Human Robot Teams\nAbstract: Recent advances in the areas of human-robot interaction (HRI) and robot\nautonomy are changing the world. Today robots are used in a variety of\napplications. People and robots work together in human autonomous teams (HATs)\nto accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust\nbetween robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective\nteam cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI,\nhuman trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the\nrobotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low\nperformance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task\nfailures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is\nalso important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is\nexhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger,\ndistraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to\ncalibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to\nrespect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human\nshould trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its\nfeedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust\ncalibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans. This\ninformation is potentially useful in aiding a robot it its decision to respect\ntrust.\n\n6. Trust Considerations for Explainable Robots: A Human Factors Perspective\nAbstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have drawn\nattention to the need for AI systems and robots to be understandable to human\nusers. The explainable AI (XAI) and explainable robots literature aims to\nenhance human understanding and human-robot team performance by providing users\nwith necessary information about AI and robot behavior. Simultaneously, the\nhuman factors literature has long addressed important considerations that\ncontribute to human performance, including human trust in autonomous systems.\nIn this paper, drawing from the human factors literature, we discuss three\nimportant trust-related considerations for the design of explainable robot\nsystems: the bases of trust, trust calibration, and trust specificity. We\nfurther detail existing and potential metrics for assessing trust in robotic\nsystems based on explanations provided by explainable robots.\n\n7. Experimental Investigation of Trust in Anthropomorphic Agents as Task\n  Partners\nAbstract: This study investigated whether human trust in a social robot with\nanthropomorphic physicality is similar to that in an AI agent or in a human in\norder to clarify how anthropomorphic physicality influences human trust in an\nagent. We conducted an online experiment using two types of cognitive tasks,\ncalculation and emotion recognition tasks, where participants answered after\nreferring to the answers of an AI agent, a human, or a social robot. During the\nexperiment, the participants rated their trust levels in their partners. As a\nresult, trust in the social robot was basically neither similar to that in the\nAI agent nor in the human and instead settled between them. The results showed\na possibility that manipulating anthropomorphic features would help assist\nhuman users in appropriately calibrating trust in an agent.\n\n8. Uncalibrated Models Can Improve Human-AI Collaboration\nAbstract: In many practical applications of AI, an AI model is used as a decision aid\nfor human users. The AI provides advice that a human (sometimes) incorporates\ninto their decision-making process. The AI advice is often presented with some\nmeasure of "confidence" that the human can use to calibrate how much they\ndepend on or trust the advice. In this paper, we present an initial exploration\nthat suggests showing AI models as more confident than they actually are, even\nwhen the original AI is well-calibrated, can improve human-AI performance\n(measured as the accuracy and confidence of the human\'s final prediction after\nseeing the AI advice). We first train a model to predict human incorporation of\nAI advice using data from thousands of human-AI interactions. This enables us\nto explicitly estimate how to transform the AI\'s prediction confidence, making\nthe AI uncalibrated, in order to improve the final human prediction. We\nempirically validate our results across four different tasks--dealing with\nimages, text and tabular data--involving hundreds of human participants. We\nfurther support our findings with simulation analysis. Our findings suggest the\nimportance of jointly optimizing the human-AI system as opposed to the standard\nparadigm of optimizing the AI model alone.\n\n9. Knowing About Knowing: An Illusion of Human Competence Can Hinder\n  Appropriate Reliance on AI Systems\nAbstract: The dazzling promises of AI systems to augment humans in various tasks hinge\non whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown\nthat appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team\nperformance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an\nunder-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people\ncan hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive\nbias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and\nperformance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of\nDKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be\nmitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI\nadvice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user\nunderstanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their\nperformance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal\nteam performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either\nimproving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate\nreliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users\ncalibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among\nparticipants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can\npotentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated\nself-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to\ntackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI\nsystems. Our findings advance the current understanding of the role of\nself-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This\nlays out promising future directions for relevant HCI research in this\ncommunity.\n\n10. A Turing Test for Transparency\nAbstract: A central goal of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the\ntrust relationship in human-AI interaction. One assumption underlying research\nin transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess\npredictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to\nidentify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however\nshows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting\nexplanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even\nwhen these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be\nattributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This\neffect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of\ntransparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish\nmachine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative\nmetric for XAI methods based on Turing\'s imitation game, a Turing Test for\nTransparency. A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was\ngenerated by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can\nnot be detected by humans above chance performance in this binary\nclassification task are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a\nrequirement for assessing and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI\ninteraction. We present experimental results on a crowd-sourced text\nclassification task demonstrating that even for basic ML models and XAI\napproaches most participants were not able to differentiate human from machine\ngenerated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical implications of our\nresults for applications of transparent ML.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nAfter analyzing the abstracts of the top 10 arxiv papers related to trust calibration in AI-based systems, I have identified the following application domains studied by these papers:\n\n1.

Explainable AI (XAI) and transparency: Papers 3, 8, and 10 explore the role of explanations and transparency in AI systems, addressing issues such as trust in explanations, uncalibrated models, and the Turing Test for Transparency.\n\n4. Human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective on user trust in AI-enabled systems: Paper 4 presents a systematic literature review of user trust in AI-enabled systems from an HCI perspective, discussing trust definitions, influencing factors, and measurement methods.\n\n5. Anthropomorphic agents and social robots: Paper 7 investigates the influence of anthropomorphic physicality on human trust in agents, comparing trust in AI agents, humans, and social robots.\n\nThese application domains provide insights into various aspects of trust calibration in AI-based systems, including decision-making, human-robot interaction, explainable AI, and user trust from an HCI perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nuser_proxy (to assistant):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-python",children:'task3 = """Use this data to generate a bar chart of domains and number of papers in that domain and save to a file\n"""\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=task3, clear_history=False)\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:'user_proxy (to assistant):\n\nUse this data to generate a bar chart of domains and number of papers in that domain and save to a file \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nI will create a Python script that generates a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain using the data we have analyzed.

This library allows downloading of historical market data from Yahoo Finance.\n\nLet's proceed in the following steps:\n\n1. I will provide you a Python script that utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch the current stock prices and historical data for the past month for both NVDA and TSLA.\n2. The script will then calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the past month.\n\nPlease make sure that you have `yfinance` installed in your Python environment before running the script. You can install it using `pip install yfinance`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Function to get current stock price\ndef get_stock_price(stock_ticker):\n    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\n    todays_data = stock.history(period='1d')\n    return todays_data['Close'][0]\n\n# Function to calculate percentage change over the past month\ndef get_percentage_change(stock_ticker):\n    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\n    end_date = datetime.now()\n    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)\n    historical_data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)\n    price_end = historical_data['Close'][-1]\n    price_start = historical_data['Close'][0]\n    percent_change = ((price_end - price_start)/price_start) * 100\n    return percent_change\n\n# Getting the current price and performance for NVDA and TSLA\nnvda_price = get_stock_price('NVDA')\ntesla_price = get_stock_price('TSLA')\nnvda_change = get_percentage_change('NVDA')\ntesla_change = get_percentage_change('TSLA')\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock price: ${nvda_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"TESLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock price: ${tesla_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"NVDA percentage change over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TESLA percentage change over past month: {tesla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nPlease run this script in your environment and share with me the output.

This may provide insights into any events or announcements that could have influenced investor sentiment and thus the stock price. \n\nI will now write a Python script to search for recent news articles for both NVDA and TSLA using a web scraping library. Please note that this script will return the latest publicly available news gathered from news websites that provide RSS feeds or have structured data appropriate for scraping. For more in-depth analysis, professional financial services or databases like Bloomberg Terminal would be more suitable, though these often require subscriptions. \n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to fetch recent news headlines for both companies:\n\n```python\n# filename: fetch_stock_news.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Define the URLs of the news sources you want to scrape\n# As an example, I'm using Google News RSS feed URLs for NVIDIA and Tesla.\n# You can change these URLs to any other news source that you prefer.\nnvidia_news_url = \"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=NVIDIA+NVDA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\"\ntesla_news_url = \"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Tesla+TSLA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\"\n\ndef fetch_news(url):\n    # Send a request to the URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    # Check if the request was successful\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        raise Exception(f\"Request to {url} failed with status code {response.status_code}\")\n    \n    # Parse HTML content\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, features='xml')\n    articles = soup.find_all('item')\n\n    # Extract news titles\n    news_headlines = [article.title.text for article in articles]\n\n    return news_headlines\n\ndef main():\n    # Fetch news for NVIDIA\n    print(\"Recent NVIDIA (NVDA) News Headlines:\")\n    try:\n        nvidia_news = fetch_news(nvidia_news_url)\n        for idx, headline in enumerate(nvidia_news, 1):\n            print(f\"{idx}. {headline}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while fetching NVIDIA news: {e}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\")  # Add a newline for better readability\n\n    # Fetch news for Tesla\n    print(\"Recent Tesla (TSLA) News Headlines:\")\n    try:\n        tesla_news = fetch_news(tesla_news_url)\n        for idx, headline in enumerate(tesla_news, 1):\n            print(f\"{idx}. {headline}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while fetching Tesla news: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nPlease save this script as `fetch_stock_news.py` and run it.

In the latest chapter of this financial epic, we turn our gaze to two behemoths of innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Each tells a story as captivating as the next, but with decidedly different plot twists.\n\n**NVIDIA's Ascension: A Graphical Powerhouse**\n\nPicture this: a company whose fortunes are soaring, much like the rockets that its technology could one day help to navigate through the stars. NVIDIA, known for transforming pixels into beautiful imagery, is now transforming its numbers with just as much finesse. Let's delve into the specifics with a table that paints a thousand words\u2014or in this case, numbers:\n\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\n\nWhat we see is a whopping 30.65% increase in NVIDIA's stock price over the past month. But what has fueled this impressive growth? Analysts might point to a confluence of factors: a resounding optimism in earnings growth, NVIDIA's coronation as the third-largest US company by market value, a strong current of institutional investor confidence, and a strategic play in the buzz-filled field of artificial intelligence.\n\n**Tesla's Twist: When Currents Shift**\n\nContrast this with the journey Tesla has embarked upon. Once a darling of the market, it presently faces a twist in its narrative, marked by a 7% decrease in its stock price within the same timeframe. Tesla's plot thickens with a concoction of concerns: a potential slowdown in the electric vehicle market, turbulence sewn by bearish institutional sentiment, a series of questions around corporate governance, and the larger, shadowy figure of global economic uncertainty that lurks in the background.\n\n**Deciphering the Stories Behind the Statistics**\n\nWhat these figures don't capture is the rich tapestry of human decisions, innovations, fears, and aspirations that drive them. NVIDIA's current favored status among investors may be underpinned by its key strides in technology that promise to unlock new capabilities in various sectors, while Tesla's challenges might reflect the intricate dance of market expectations with real-world deliverables. Each stock price movement is a reflection of myriad stories unfolding within and around these corporate giants.\n\n**An Investor's Prose: Caution Amidst Narratives**\n\nAs a savvy observer of the market's grand narrative, caution remains a protagonist. Remember, stock prices are as volatile as the oceans\u2014serene one day, stormy the next. While NVIDIA's rise and Tesla's stumble are today's headlines, tomorrow might tell a different tale. For the most accurate pulse, ensure you're synced with the heartbeat of the market through real-time data and a diversified suite of financial news sources.\n\nToday, NVIDIA basks in the glow of market approval, while Tesla navigates a patch of rough seas. But as any veteran of the markets will tell you, fortunes can reverse in the blink of an eye. As long as innovation remains at their core and adaptability in their strategies, both companies are poised for the next chapter in their storied existences.\n\nAnd whether as cautionary tale or heroic epic, you can be certain that the market will be there to tell the tale.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser_Proxy (to writer):\n\nToo short. Enrich it. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwriter (to User_Proxy):\n\n**The Silicon Symbiosis: A Contrast in Fortunes**\n\nIn the realm of high technology and financial markets, the narrative is as dynamic as it is unpredictable. Every tradesman's tick and investor's tock is part of an intricate symphony, with movements both adagio and allegro. Today, we cast our spotlight on two titans that have come to symbolically represent the march of modern innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Their stories, though interwoven by the common thread of cutting-edge technology, are currently humming different melodies in the stock market concerto.\n\n**NVIDIA's Flourishing Financial Canvas**\n\nAllow me to direct your eyes to a visual that speaks volumes\u2014a financial figure that captivates the analytical mind as surely as a work of art steals the gaze of its onlooker:\n\n*Table 1: Comparative Stock Performances*\n\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\n\nIn just one month, NVIDIA has seen a dramatic surge in its stock price, a robust 30.65% climb that mirrors the steep inclines of a mountainous ascent. Yet, this ascent is no mere accident of fate. It has been prodded by a series of catalysts, each more powerful than the last. Analysts may suggest that NVIDIA's performance is reflective of a positive outlook on earnings growth, the magnifying glass of confidence from institutional investors, and its strategic investment in artificial intelligence\u2014a field that promises to redefine the boundaries of possibility.\n\nThis growth is no less significant for having catapulted NVIDIA to newfound heights, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. company by market value. In the eyes of many, NVIDIA is not merely a company but a canvas upon which the future of technology is being painted.\n\n**Tesla's Tales of Caution and Volatility**\n\nIn sharp contrast stands Tesla, the electric automaker whose brand has become synonymous with the future of transportation. Despite the sheen of innovation and Elon Musk's vision, the company's current stock price reflects a narrative tinged with uncertainty. The -7% dip might be seen as a momentary pause in the company\u2019s otherwise stellar performance, but it whispers tales of doubt regarding slowing electric vehicle demand and the complex ballet of investor sentiment in the face of corporate governance queries and Musk's multifaceted public persona.\n\nThe fluctuating script encapsulating Tesla's value also underscores the inherent volatility of the stock market, heavily influenced by external economic narratives and internal corporate dramas. Tesla's story is a complex one, layered with futuristic ambitions tempered by the current climate of economic restraint.\n\n**The Interplay of Market Forces and Human Emotion**\n\nBeyond the arithmetic of stock prices lies the human element: the restless drive for invention against the cautious tug of preservation. NVIDIA\u2019s surge speaks of human ambition crystallized into financial momentum, while Tesla\u2019s recent dip reflects the cautious pullback of a market wary of sprinting ahead of its own shadow.\n\nBut these stock price reflections are but shadows of a larger drama\u2014the ebb and flow of market sentiments that can turn on the dime of a quarterly report or a tweet-storm. The savvy investor or curious spectator must look beneath the surface waves to the currents below, charting movements with the precision of a cartographer mapping uncharted seas.\n\n**Heed the Market's Mutable Muse**\n\nWe conclude with a note of prudence: embrace the complex stories of NVIDIA and Tesla, but anchor your investment decisions in the bedrock of real-time data and comprehensive analytics. The stock market is a creature of change, and its story is written anew each day. Embrace the power of informed speculation, but be wary of the market's mutable muse.\n\nFor as the curtains fall on today's account of NVIDIA's stellar ascension and Tesla's contemplative descent, one can only wonder what twists the next act will hold. The market is, after all, the grandest theater of all\u2014a stage where fortunes are made and dreams may either be woven into reality or unravel before the audience's eyes.\n\nAs the tales of these two tech giants continue to unfold, whether they lead to further success or unexpected downturns, they exemplify the vibrancy and the volatility inherent in our quest to predicate the future on the promise of progress.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h4,{id:"check-chat-results",children:"Check chat results"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["The ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"initiate_chat"})," method returns a ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"ChatResult"})," object, which is a\ndataclass object storing information about the chat.

Every tradesman's tick and investor's tock is part of an intricate symphony, with movements both adagio and allegro. Today, we cast our spotlight on two titans that have come to symbolically represent the march of modern innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Their stories, though interwoven by the common thread of cutting-edge technology, are currently humming different melodies in the stock market concerto.\n\n**NVIDIA's Flourishing Financial Canvas**\n\nAllow me to direct your eyes to a visual that speaks volumes\u2014a financial figure that captivates the analytical mind as surely as a work of art steals the gaze of its onlooker:\n\n*Table 1: Comparative Stock Performances*\n\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\n\nIn just one month, NVIDIA has seen a dramatic surge in its stock price, a robust 30.65% climb that mirrors the steep inclines of a mountainous ascent. Yet, this ascent is no mere accident of fate. It has been prodded by a series of catalysts, each more powerful than the last. Analysts may suggest that NVIDIA's performance is reflective of a positive outlook on earnings growth, the magnifying glass of confidence from institutional investors, and its strategic investment in artificial intelligence\u2014a field that promises to redefine the boundaries of possibility.\n\nThis growth is no less significant for having catapulted NVIDIA to newfound heights, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. company by market value. In the eyes of many, NVIDIA is not merely a company but a canvas upon which the future of technology is being painted.\n\n**Tesla's Tales of Caution and Volatility**\n\nIn sharp contrast stands Tesla, the electric automaker whose brand has become synonymous with the future of transportation. Despite the sheen of innovation and Elon Musk's vision, the company's current stock price reflects a narrative tinged with uncertainty. The -7% dip might be seen as a momentary pause in the company\u2019s otherwise stellar performance, but it whispers tales of doubt regarding slowing electric vehicle demand and the complex ballet of investor sentiment in the face of corporate governance queries and Musk's multifaceted public persona.\n\nThe fluctuating script encapsulating Tesla's value also underscores the inherent volatility of the stock market, heavily influenced by external economic narratives and internal corporate dramas. Tesla's story is a complex one, layered with futuristic ambitions tempered by the current climate of economic restraint.\n\n**The Interplay of Market Forces and Human Emotion**\n\nBeyond the arithmetic of stock prices lies the human element: the restless drive for invention against the cautious tug of preservation. NVIDIA\u2019s surge speaks of human ambition crystallized into financial momentum, while Tesla\u2019s recent dip reflects the cautious pullback of a market wary of sprinting ahead of its own shadow.\n\nBut these stock price reflections are but shadows of a larger drama\u2014the ebb and flow of market sentiments that can turn on the dime of a quarterly report or a tweet-storm. The savvy investor or curious spectator must look beneath the surface waves to the currents below, charting movements with the precision of a cartographer mapping uncharted seas.\n\n**Heed the Market's Mutable Muse**\n\nWe conclude with a note of prudence: embrace the complex stories of NVIDIA and Tesla, but anchor your investment decisions in the bedrock of real-time data and comprehensive analytics. The stock market is a creature of change, and its story is written anew each day. Embrace the power of informed speculation, but be wary of the market's mutable muse.\n\nFor as the curtains fall on today's account of NVIDIA's stellar ascension and Tesla's contemplative descent, one can only wonder what twists the next act will hold. The market is, after all, the grandest theater of all\u2014a stage where fortunes are made and dreams may either be woven into reality or unravel before the audience's eyes.\n\nAs the tales of these two tech giants continue to unfold, whether they lead to further success or unexpected downturns, they exemplify the vibrancy and the volatility inherent in our quest to predicate the future on the promise of progress.\n\n\nHuman input in the middle: ['Too short.

If you've been keeping an eye on the tech industry, you've probably noticed the electrifying performance of two market giants: NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). Over the past month, these stocks have taken investors on quite the ride, and we're here to break down the twists and turns.\n\n## NVIDIA: A Journey Through the Digital Realm\n\nNVIDIA, the powerhouse behind some of the most advanced graphics processing technologies, began February modestly at $661.60. However, it didn't take long for this tech titan to start climbing. By February 5, we saw NVDA accelerating to a cool $693.32, hinting at the potential for a thrilling month ahead. The momentum wasn't constant, though, with minor dips, like the one on February 6th to $682.23, reminding shareholders that the journey wouldn't be without its bumps.\n\nMidway through the month, there came a slight calm before the storm, as the stock hovered around $720, suggesting that something big was on the horizon. And true to form, on February 22nd, NVIDIA took everyone by surprise as it surged to an impressive $785.38.\n\nThe climax of this exhilarating ride came as February gave way to March, with NVIDIA stock skyrocketing to an apex of $822.79. Investors buckled in tight surely enjoyed the view from this peak.\n\n## Tesla: Charging Ahead with Volatility\n\nTesla, well-loved and -debated for its visionary approach to automotive technology, also delivered its fair share of market excitement. Starting on a lower key at $187.91, TSLA had a more modest opening than NVDA but held promise for an interesting chapter.\n\nThe stock dropped to a monthly low of $181.06 on February 5, causing a bit of heart-in-mouth for supporters. Yet, in classic Tesla fashion, the company steered back onto the track, recovering to $185.10 the next day. Over the next few days, Tesla continued to inch higher, reaching $189.56 by February 8th.\n\nDespite a temporary retreat mid-month, where the stock dipped to $188.13, the electric automaker charged back with vigor, breaking the $200 barrier and hitting a high of $200.45 on February 15th - giving investors a much-needed adrenaline boost.\n\nAs February ended and March began, Tesla maintained a price over $200, somewhat steadying the wheel for a close at $202.64, a reassuring end to a month of market fluctuations.\n\n## What's Behind the Movements?\n\nWhile the numbers tell one story, they don't explain the 'why' behind these market rides. For NVIDIA, a series of positive earnings reports, strategic partnerships, and strong demand for gaming and server GPUs contributed to its stock gains. For Tesla, market sentiment often hinged on production milestones, regulatory news, and the ever-present Twitter activity of its CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nIt's important to remember that the stock market is influenced by a complex web of factors, including investor sentiment, industry trends, geopolitical events, and economic indicators. As such, companies like NVIDIA and Tesla don't just operate in a vacuum\u2014every shift in the market can be an echo of larger global narratives.\n\n## An Investor's Perspective\n\nThe past month's performance of NVDA and TSLA provides valuable lessons for investors. It showcases the importance of staying informed and understanding that volatility is part and parcel of the investing experience, especially in sectors like technology where innovation is rapid and competition fierce.\n\nWhile these price swings may cause some to balk, seasoned stock market enthusiasts know that these fluctuations can present opportunities. Whether leveraging these movements for short-term gains or buckling in for the long haul, understanding the story behind the numbers is crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, the tale of NVDA and TSLA over the past month has been nothing short of a nail-biter. As we keep our eyes glued to the screens for the next series of movements, always remember: investing is not just about the figures; it's about seeing the whole picture and appreciating every twist and turn of the story that unfolds.\n\nStay tuned, fasten your seatbelts, and until next time, may your portfolio's story be equally thrilling and rewarding.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},24911:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{assets:()=>c,contentTitle:()=>s,default:()=>h,frontMatter:()=>i,metadata:()=>r,toc:()=>l});var a=t(85893),o=t(11151);const i={custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",description:"This comprehensive example demonstrates the use of tools in a GPTAssistantAgent Multi-Agent System by utilizing functions such as calling an API and writing to a file.",source_notebook:"/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",tags:["open ai assistant","gpt assistant","tool use"],title:"From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent"},s="From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent",r={id:"notebooks/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call",title:"From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent",description:"This comprehensive example demonstrates the use of tools in a GPTAssistantAgent Multi-Agent System by utilizing functions such as calling an API and writing to a file.",source:"@site/docs/notebooks/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.mdx",sourceDirName:"notebooks",slug:"/notebooks/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call",draft:!1,unlisted:!1,editUrl:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",tags:[{label:"open ai assistant",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/open-ai-assistant"},{label:"gpt assistant",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/gpt-assistant"},{label:"tool use",permalink:"/autogen/docs/tags/tool-use"}],version:"current",frontMatter:{custom_edit_url:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/edit/main/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",description:"This comprehensive example demonstrates the use of tools in a GPTAssistantAgent Multi-Agent System by utilizing functions such as calling an API and writing to a file.",source_notebook:"/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",tags:["open ai assistant","gpt assistant","tool use"],title:"From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent"},sidebar:"notebooksSidebar",previous:{title:"Solving Multiple Tasks in a Sequence of Chats with Different Conversable Agent Pairs",permalink:"/autogen/docs/notebooks/agentchats_sequential_chats"}},c={},l=[{value:"Requirements",id:"requirements",level:2},{value:"Creating the Functions",id:"creating-the-functions",level:2},{value:"Create Function Schemas",id:"create-function-schemas",level:2},{value:"Creating the Agents",id:"creating-the-agents",level:2},{value:"Set up the User Proxy",id:"set-up-the-user-proxy",level:3},{value:"The Dad Agent",id:"the-dad-agent",level:3},{value:"The Sad Joker Agent",id:"the-sad-joker-agent",level:3},{value:"Creating the Groupchat and Starting the Conversation",id:"creating-the-groupchat-and-starting-the-conversation",level:2}];function d(e){const n={a:"a",code:"code",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",img:"img",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"from-dad-jokes-to-sad-jokes-function-calling-with-gptassistantagent",children:"From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg",alt:"Open In Colab"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/gpt_assistant_agent_function_call.ipynb",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.img,{src:"https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20GitHub-grey?logo=github",alt:"Open on GitHub"})})]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Autogen allows ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"GPTAssistantAgent"})," to be augmented with \u201ctools\u201d \u2014\npre-defined functions or capabilities \u2014 that extend its ability to\nhandle specific tasks, similar to how one might natively utilize tools\nin the ",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools",children:"OpenAI Assistant\u2019s\nAPI"}),"."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["In this notebook, we create a basic Multi-Agent System using Autogen\u2019s\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"GPTAssistantAgent"})," to convert Dad jokes on a specific topic into Sad\njokes.
